Stretching—you can take it or leave it. But can you really?
If you’re someone who exercises regularly and stays active, you may not notice anything for a
while. Your diet's okay, you stay lean, and you look just as great as you feel. You may ask
yourself: Why do I need to stretch?
It's a common mistake to think that stretching is exclusive to yogis and runners—that is until
you wake up one morning with a flinching pain in your lower back. Your instincts kick in and
you stretch for a bit, feeling temporary relief. You go on about your day as usual, and you forget
about the pain you felt that morning. You head back to the gym like the beast that you are.
It becomes a cycle. There will be days when you feel like you need a stretch. The pain persists
but you don’t think it's a big deal. You forget about it again, but the villainous pain on your
lower back doesn’t give you a respite anymore. This is when you figure out that something's
wrong.
So, what happened?Your prosthesis becomes your main suspect for this injury, however, it can be isolated from
wearing a prosthetic in the first place. This is a type of pain that could have been avoided.
Because you haven't been regularly stretching, your hip flexors tighten. If you're an above-knee
amputee, the tighter your hip flexors are, the more work and strain is required from your lower
back. As your hamstrings get tighter, your pelvis gets pulled down with them, which then
changes your spine's curvature.
As it gets worse from sitting all day, your hamstring retracts, the lumbar curve vanishes, and
your posture gets bad. Say hello to vertebral herniation (a.k.a. slip disc).
Now you know what the problem is, what should you do?
It's time to get moving and get your muscles working. This can be the push you need to finally
sign up for a beginner’s yoga class. Or you can also stretch at home with these 8 moves:

Knee Flexor or Hamstring Stretch
• Sit on the edge of a hard furniture, like a sofa.
• Point the leg you'll be stretching in front of you.
• Hang your opposite leg to the side.• Gradually lean forward until you feel some resistance in the back of your
extended leg.
• Remember not to bounce!
------------------

Prone Position (Face Down)
• Lie on your stomach.
• If you're a below-knee amputee, place a towel under your leg above your
knee, or close to the end of your residual limb if you're an AK amputee.
• Keep enough leverage on the front of your hip and thigh.
------------------(photo courtesy of Amputee Coalition)
Supine Position (Face Up)
• Sit on the edge of a bed or mat.
• Lie back while you grab the opposite leg from the one you'd stretch.
• The stretched residual limb should be hanging in the air.
• Apply the pressure downward to your residual limb with an ankle weight or
ask another person for support.
------------------(photo courtesy of Amputee Coalition)
Flexor Stretch
• On a table or hard surface, place your residual limb horizontally with a rolled
towel under your arm just above your elbow.
• Apply downward pressure to the end of your residual limb until you feel a
stretch.

Extensor Stretch
• Bend your residual limb at the elbow as far back as you can.
• Apply some pressure to the back of your forearm until you feel a stretch.
Shoulder Stretch
If you have an upper limb that's amputated, you may have noticed that you have limited
shoulder motion due to decreased activity. To remedy this, make sure to include some
shoulder stretches daily to keep your shoulder working."
7 Exercises to Help You Stay in Shape While on Crutches,"7 Exercises to Help You Stay in Shape
While on Crutches
• July 25, 2019
To Maintain Your Physical Fitness During the Healing Process, Try Out These
Exercises, All of Which Can Be Performed While on Crutches
When you’ve worked hard to make health and exercise a priority in your life,
getting injured and ending up on crutches can seem like a major setback.
If you’re itching to start moving again, we have some great news: you can
exercise while on crutches.
To maintain your physical fitness during the healing process, try out these
exercises, all of which can be performed while on crutches.
1. Arm ExercisesSome of the best exercises while on crutches are arm exercises as they don’t
require you to put any weight or pressure on your injured leg. Working out with
arm exercises helps you maintain both cardio and upper body strength. Some
great upper body exercises include:
• Front arm raises
• Sidearm raises
• Lat pulldowns
• Arm circles
• Shoulder shrugs
• Bicep curls
• Shoulder press
There are dozens of arm exercises you can do while on crutches. You can
continue to build arm strength despite your leg injury if you use your healing
time to try new exercises and work muscles you might not normally train.
2. Light Walking
If your injury allows, light walking while on crutches is a good option for getting
in some cardio.
If your injury is non-weight bearing, don’t worry. The iWALK 2.0 mobility
device offers great support for injuries below the knee. This handless crutch
enables you to easily move around the gym and will make it possible for you
to get back to walking while you’re on crutches.
3. Ab and Core Exercises
Another great group of exercises to perform while on crutches involve your
core.
The Mayo Clinic recommends building abdominal strength to help improve
posture, reduce muscle injuries, and improve back pain. Since core stability is
essential, especially while you’re on crutches, improve ab strength with these
exercises:
• Sit-ups
• V-sit ups
• Roll-ups
• Side bendsCombining core exercises with upper body exercises and weight training will
help you maintain good overall fitness while you’re on crutches.
4. Cardio Exercises
In addition to building strength with core and weight training, getting some
cardio exercise is essential for maintaining good health.
Getting cardio exercise while on crutches requires some creativity, but it is
possible. Bring this list of upper-body cardio exercises to your doctor or
physical therapist to see what they recommend for you:
• Arm bike/upper-body ergometer
• Walking with a hands-free crutch
• Arm circles
• Punching (kickboxing with the upper body)
• Battle Ropes
You may also wonder, “is walking on crutches good exercise?” The answer is:
absolutely!
Walking on crutches certainly qualifies as exercise because it requires a lot of
upper body strength and burns more calories than walking without crutches
does. However, using crutches incorrectly during cardio exercise can causeunderarm pain, result in underarm nerve damage, and pose a risk to your
injured leg.
The iWALK 2.0 mobility device solves these issues. It makes walking
comfortable for those with injuries below the knee. This handless crutch
allows you to quickly get back to walking, and makes it easier to move around
at the gym while you’re exercising. It also provides incredible stability without
putting any pressure under your arms, making it safe and pain-free to use.
5. Leg Exercises (With Caution)
Depending on the type of injury you have, you may be able to do some low
impact leg exercises while on crutches.
Some leg exercises on crutches might include a variety of leg lifts or
resistance band training. However, performing improper movements
repetitively can slow your recovery process and keep you on crutches for
longer. For this reason, always consult with your doctor and physical therapist
before doing any leg exercises while on crutches.
6. Aquatic Exercises
If you’re looking for an option that doesn’t require the use of crutches, aquatic
exercises can be a great fit. Working out in a pool allows those with injuries to
perform effective low impact exercises. Talk to your doctor and physical
therapist to see if aquatic exercises are right for your situation.
7. Full-Body Chair Exercises
If your injury has kept you chair-bound, it’s still possible to exercise.
Chair exercises can be modified for intensity or if you need to avoid using your
legs entirely.
YouTube has some great seated cardio workout videos that show you how to
engage in a full-body cardio workout while in a chair. We’ve included chair
workouts in this list of exercises on crutches because they’ll help those with
injuries to stay in shape during recovery.
Stay in Shape Doing Exercises on CrutchesGetting enough exercise while on crutches requires some additional planning
and effort, but it’s worth maintaining your health. No matter your current
fitness level, doing exercises on crutches can help you maintain your health
during the healing process."

INCREASE WHOLE-BODY STRENGTH WITH THESE EIGHT SEATED
EXERCISES
Usually, when we think about exercise, we think about activities that involve
standing, walking, and moving around. For seniors constricted to a wheelchair, these
types of activities are, of course, impossible. Yet, regular exercise is just as important
for seniors in wheelchairs who want to lead an active, healthy, happy life as it is for
seniors who do not require the use of a wheelchair.
For many older adults, a loss of autonomy and independence can contribute to
feelings of depression and loneliness. Not being able to engage in normal day-to-day
activities like lifting basic household items, moving freely from room to room, or
from inside to outside, without assistance is frustrating and can lead to a sense of
despair that puts them at risk for further illness and injury.But, strength training can make daily life much easier for wheelchair users. When
you’re strong, simply moving through the day goes from a challenge to a pleasure - a
reminder of improved fitness and health, that continues to motivate training.
Download our free guide on the 5 key features to look for in senior strength training
equipment.
THESE 8 STRENGTH TRAINING EXERCISES ARE AN EFFECTIVE
WAY TO SUPPORT THE INDEPENDENCE OF SENIORS IN
WHEELCHAIRS AND IMPROVE DAILY LIFE.
A complete circuit of the following 8 exercises will build strength in the arms, chest,
core, and legs, providing a simple whole-body strength training workout for
wheelchair users. During the workout, seniors should take care to sit tall, engaging
their abs to maintain good posture and support the muscles of the back.
Beginners should start with a small number of reps and skip the exercises that require
weight or resistance. As muscle strength improves, increase the number of reps and
add weight or resistance.
For maximum effectiveness, perform strength training exercises 2-3 non-consecutive
days a week, taking at least 1 day to rest in between workouts.

EXERCISES THAT STRENGTHEN THE MUSCLES IN THE ARMS AND
CHEST
1. Shoulder Retractions for Beginners
Sit up straight and contract the ab muscles to support back muscles. Hold your arms at
a 90-degree angle at shoulder level, hands facing down, fingers curved as if griping
bicycle handles. Push both arms straight out in front of you, extending as far as
possible without locking the joints. Bend the elbows and pull your arms back untilyour elbows are just slightly behind your torso, squeezing the shoulder blades together
you do, and then repeat the motion.
To increase the intensity, hold a light resistance band with both hands. Extend arms
parallel to the floor and pull the band apart, squeezing the Rhomboid muscles.
Alternatively, attach a resistance band to a wall or doorknob. Hold the band with arms
extended and pull towards your body, bending the elbows slightly behind your torso.
2. Chest Squeeze with, or without, a medicine ball
Sitting up straight, with abs engaged to support the muscles in the back, hold a
medicine ball, rubber ball, or balloon at chest level, squeezing the ball between your
hands to contract the chest muscles. Slowly push the ball forward until your elbows
are nearly straight, continuing to squeeze the ball through the whole movement.
Slowly pull the ball back to the chest and repeat.
For beginners, this exercise can be accomplished without the medicine ball simply by
pressing the palms together.
3. Chest Press with resistance band
Wrap a resistance band around the back of your wheelchair, or simply wrap it around
your back just below your shoulder blades. Sitting tall and with your abs engaged,
grasp each end of the resistant band in your hands and hold your arms at a 90-degree
angle at shoulder level with the palms facing down. Extend your arms straight out infront of your body as far as you can go without locking the joints. Hold the stretch for
2 seconds and then bring the arms back to start.
Be sure to keep the movement slow and controlled with the arms held close to your
sides during each repetition.

Exercises for Wheelchair Users.
SEATED WHEELCHAIR EXERCISES THAT STRENGTHEN THE LEG
MUSCLES
1. Toe Taps
Sit up straight with abs engaged and feet flat on the ground. Tilt your toes up towards
the ceiling and then back down to the floor. Repeat several times.
To increase the level of difficulty, raise one leg in the air so that it’s straight out in
front of you, keeping the other foot flat on the floor. Tilt toes up and down several
times. Lower the foot back down to the floor and repeat with the other leg.
2. Knee lifts
Sit up straight with abs engaged and feet flat on the ground. Slowly lift your right leg,
bending your knee in a marching motion. Lift your leg as high as you can comfortably
go, then lower your foot back to the floor and repeat with the other leg. Continue to
repeat this motion, alternating legs.
For increased intensity, pause for 2-10 seconds at the top of the movement.
For additional lower body exercises check out, 7 Seated Exercises for Seniors to
Improve Strength.SEATED WHEELCHAIR EXERCISES THAT STRENGTHEN THE
MUSCLES OF THE CORE AND ABS
1. Tummy Twist
Sit up straight with abs engaged and feet flat on the ground. Hold both arms at a 90-
degree angle, with forearms extended in front of you and elbows at your sides. Rotate
your upper torso to the left, twisting at the waist, for as far as you can comfortably go.
Twist back to center and repeat the motion to the right.
During the movement, imagine sucking in your belly button towards your spine, and
keep your lower body completely still.
2. Captain’s Chair
Sit up straight and grab the front edge of your seat with both hands. Slowly lift both of
your feet off the floor, bending your knees towards your chest as you do, lifting as
high as you comfortably can. Squeeze your abs at the top of the movement, and lower
both feet back to the floor.
Be careful to not raise your legs past a comfortable position. If you are only able to
raise your feet a few inches off the floor to start, that’s fine.
3. The Side Bend StretchSit up tall, with abdominal muscles contracted and hips facing squarely forward.
Extend your left arm toward the ceiling, keeping the inside of your upper arm very
close to your ear. Hold your left arm in that position, and slowly bend your entire
upper body to the right, making a “C” shape with your spine.
To increase the intensity, reach your right arm towards the floor. Hold the stretch for
5-15 seconds. Slowly move back to center and repeat on the other side.

Keep Moving
The previous article discussed exercises to help you maintain the range of motion
(ROM) in your limbs and back and help you get moving again after an amputation.
Many of those activities can be made more challenging by adding weight, not using any
object for support, standing instead of sitting, or even standing on one leg. If you have
already mastered those activities, you can keep moving by trying the following
advanced exercises. As always, please be sure to check with your physician or physical
therapist before beginning any exercises. Your fitness level, your general health, and
the condition of your residual limb will all play a role in how rigorously you can exercise.
A qualified health professional can teach you how to stay within your target heart range.
Strength Exercises
Strength is needed in each leg, your arms and your trunk (stomach and back). In
addition to your legs, your stomach and back muscles play a crucial role in standing and
moving. If your trunk is not strong, it will not be able to hold up to the demands you
make on it all day every day.
Seated push upPlace a stable chair against a wall to prevent it from tipping over. While
sitting in the chair, place your hands on the armrests. Push down into the armrests to
raise your hips one to two inches off of the seat and then rest. To make this more
difficult, lift one leg.
Partial squats
Hold onto a sturdy piece of furniture or the kitchen sink. Place even weight
onto both legs, and simply squat as if you are sitting on a very tall stool. You’re not
working toward a full squat. Do this 10 times. Exercising the muscles of your thighs will
make it easier to sit and rise from a chair
Wall squat (More advanced)
Stand with your back against the wall beside a sturdy piece of furniture in
case additional support is needed. Slowly slide your body down the wall until your knees
are slightly bent. To make this exercise more diffi cult, slide a little lower down the wall
or do this on one leg. You can stand on your intact leg or your prosthetic leg. Hold this
position for fi ve to 30 seconds. Be sure to breathe the entire time you perform this
exercise. Holding your breath is bad for your heart and your hemorrhoids! If your
amputation is above the knee, you will need to do this exercise on your intact leg only
since most prosthetic knees will not support your weight if there is too much bend in the
knee.
Pelvic tiltWhile on your back, with or without your prosthesis, bend both hips
and knees to 90 degrees. Place your hands on your thighs just above your knees, and
flatten the small of your back by pressing down with your stomach muscles. Do not
allow your thighs to move. Hold this position for two to three seconds while breathing
normally. This exercise strengthens the abdominal muscle (stomach). You can make
this exercise more difficult by lifting your head.
Balance Exercises
Advanced Exercises 05One of the most difficult rehabilitation activities is retraining you
and your brain to accept weight into the socket of your prosthesis. To use your
prosthesis and its foot and knee components to their fullest advantage, however, you
must put all of your weight into the socket and use all of your leg muscles to control it.
Though it will be difficult to learn to use your remaining leg muscles to balance on each
leg while standing and walking, it will pay off in a smoother, less tiring gait.
Even weight bearing
While standing in line, shaving, or brushing your teeth, think about how much weight
you have on each leg. Do you stand with most of your weight on your unaffected leg?
Many people with an amputation shift all of their weight onto the unaffected leg and use
the prosthesis only as a perch. Stand with your weight evenly on both legs while
performing one typical daily task, such as talking on the telephone. By increasing your
awareness and changing this one simple habit, you can improve your balance on a daily
basis.
All fours
While on your hands and knees, begin by raising one arm in front
of you. Put your arm down. Now try to raise a leg behind you. When you can do this
with ease, raise your opposite arm and leg together, hold them for two to three seconds
while breathing, and relax. Then switch sides. Keep your eyes down so that you don’t
strain your neck, and keep your back flat.
Kick ballPractice this fun exercise with a friend. While you are up against a wall or
using a chair, alternate kicking a ball with one leg and then the other. Quickly changing
the leg that you kick with will help improve your balance and coordination.
Hip lift
If you don’t use a prosthesis, or when you are not wearing one,
be aware of how you hold your hip. If you tend to slouch, tighten the muscles of your
standing leg to even out your hips.
Uneven surfaces
A good way to work on your balance is to make the surface on which you are
standing uneven. Place a pillow or cushion on a carpet and stand on it. You might want
to rest your hands on a table top. For safety, be sure the pillow is on carpet and not a
slick surface. Sway back and forth slightly or reach for something on the counter. You
will need to tighten the muscles of your residual limb inside the prosthetic socket.
Agility Exercises
Once you have mastered balance activities, you will find that you are moving more
easily. It is also likely that you will be doing more, and you may find that you
occasionally need to move faster, slower, backwards or sideways. By practicing the
following exercises and varying the speed and step length, you will improve your agility
and accomplish tasks with more confidence.
BraidingUsing the back of your couch for balance assistance, take a few steps to
one side crossing your prosthetic leg in front of and then behind your unaffected leg.
Stand as straight as you can and try to use your hands for balance only. If your
amputation is above the knee, be sure to take small steps ensuring that you don’t put
too much weight on the toe of your prosthesis, which could cause the knee to bend.
Circle
walk around a chair in each direction.
Ball toss
Do this exercise with a friend. If you are using a prosthesis and
really want to challenge your balance, stand up to catch the ball. If you are not using a
prosthesis or are just beginning this exercise, sit while you catch the ball. This exercise
requires strength, coordination, balance and agility, and it’s fun!
Endurance Exercises
You have already been improving your endurance by working on your range of motion,
strength, balance and agility. Every time you do an extra repetition, use a heavier
weight, or spend more time exercising, you are improving your endurance. To focus
more on endurance, you simply need to work a little harder and a little longer at the
things you have already been doing. You might also add an aerobic activity. If you have
access to a stationary bike, a treadmill, a rower or a pool, you can use it to improve your
endurance. And, of course, there is always just plain walking. It is a good idea to seek
the assistance of a health professional to determine your current level of fitness and
your target heart rate (THR). You don’t want to stress your heart too much or too little.
Once you learn your THR and how to take your pulse, you will be able to do effective
endurance activities with confidence.
Stationary bikeIf you have a stationary bike, get on it! Stop using it as a clothes rack. You can ride a
bike with one leg. It would, however, help to have a strap to hold your foot in place. If
you cannot get on your bike, how about placing it on a table top, sitting behind the table,
and moving the pedals with your hands?
Conclusion
If you are interested in doing more exercise or have specific concerns, a physical
therapist who has experience working with people with amputations can help you. If, on
the other hand, your needs are more general and you would like to exercise at home,
several books and videos can be purchased through the Amputee Coalition to help you.
If you can set a goal, break it down into small bits, and make exercise a part of your
daily plan, you will find that it becomes a good habit. Set aside some time each day to
work on one of these activities, get a friend to join you, play some music and have some
fun. Applaud your efforts, great and small, and you will keep moving."

Introduction
The loss of a lower limb has severe implications for a person’s mobility, and
ability to perform activities of daily living.[1][2] This negatively impacts their
participation and integration into society.[3] The ultimate goal of rehabilitation
after limb loss is to ambulate successfully with the use of a prosthesis[4] and to
return to a high level of social reintegration. However, many individuals after
lower limb amputation have ""poor physical function and psychosocial
outcomes"".[5] These outcomes can be exacerbated ""by under informed
prosthesis-user expectations for function with a prosthesis.""[5] Prosthetic
rehabilitation is a complex task that ideally requires input from a
transdisciplinary rehabilitation team. However, most often physiotherapists
are in charge of the physical rehabilitation process.[6]
Overview of the Rehabilitation Process
The rehabilitation process of the lower limb amputee consists of nine
phases,[7] namely:[8]
1. Pre-operative
2. Amputation surgery
3. Acute post-surgical
4. Pre-prosthetic
5. Prosthetic prescription
6. Prosthetic training
7. Community integration
8. Vocational rehabilitation and
9. Follow up

Community Integration Resumption of roles in family and community activities. Emotional equilibrium
and healthy coping strategies. Recreational activities.
Vocational Rehabilitation Assess and plan vocational activities for the future. May need further education,
training or job modification.
Follow-up Life-long prosthetic, functional, medical assessment and emotional support
Throughout all of these phases, a rehabilitation treatment plan is utilised to
guide the care of an individual who has undergone an amputation. The
treatment plan is based on an evaluation by all specialties involved in the
rehabilitation process and acts as a guide for all team members to address
goals important to the patient and family. The level of rehabilitation
intervention is contemplated from the date of admission to the hospital and
determined after the amputation surgery and prior to discharge from the
hospital. The rehabilitative process includes:
• Ongoing medical assessment of impairments, and
• Therapy interventions to address disabilities or activity limitation
Below we define this more detailed team-focused rehabilitation process in 8
phases:

It’s important to speak with your team of doctors, particularly your surgeon, prior to
scheduling any amputation procedure. Common questions might include:
• Risks: What are the major risks to consider with this surgery? What precautions
are taken to minimize those risks? Considering the risks, is amputation the best
solution?
• Procedure: How long will the surgery take? What kind(s) of anesthesia will be
used? What measures are taken to reduce reactions to the anesthesia?
• Pain: What kind of pain should be expected after the surgery? What are the
short- and long-term pain management plans?
• Recovery: After the procedure, how long will the patient need to remain in bed?
How long in the recovery room? Will there be drains, and if so, when will they be
removed? How long will you supervise the patient’s care after surgery? When will
the stitches be removed?Pre-amputation social support
You or your loved one are not the first person to require an arm or hand amputation. As
such, consider asking your doctor for support group(s) recommendations or even
possible access to patients who have had a similar amputation (but, understand that
HIPAA regulations might limit your access). There are several different support groups
and resources available to the amputee community. Understanding your options ahead
of time can prove beneficial to your physical, emotional, and social well-being pre- and
post-amputation.
Pre-amputation consultation with your prosthetic and rehab team
During the pre-amputation consultation, your prosthetic team will meet with you or your
family to discuss your activities of daily living, your work, your goals, etc. This is done todetermine the best prosthetic approach for you from an understanding of your current
lifestyle and what your goals are. You’ll also discuss what it’s like living with an upper
extremity prosthetic and the types of prosthetic devices that you may be interested in.
The recommendations based on your vocation, recreational activities, and lifestyle will
help guide discussions about how you can expect your life to change after you’ve
received your prosthesis. You’ll learn about the available technologies, the benefits and
relative weaknesses of different products, and what is the right match for your needs.
Pre-amputation physical therapy
As with any arm and hand amputation procedure, preoperative conditioning can help
improve strength and flexibility to the shoulder, core, or other areas surrounding the
amputation location. The first step is to arrange a physical therapy session in which you
or your family member will be instructed on how to best prepare for your upcoming
amputation. Your therapist will show you some specific exercises leading up to the
surgery. They can also suggest ways to strengthen other parts of your body like
conditioning your non-dominant limb for increased usage if your dominant limb is being
removed.
Arm and Hand Amputations
There are several different types of arm and hand amputations and each type of
amputation can impact the type of prosthetic device or prosthetic technology you
ultimately choose.
What is an upper limb amputation?
An upper limb amputation is the removal of part of the forearm or arm. Amputation of
the arms and/or hands can be caused by trauma, infection, birth deformities, and cancer
or other diseases.
When and why are upper limb amputations done?
The most common reason for an amputation is poor blood flow, which if left untreated,
can cause serious infection and death of tissue. Whether the result of trauma (77% of
upper limb amputations are caused by trauma), disease or another reason, amputations
are typically done before the affected limb or area poses serious health risks to the
patient.
What are the different amputation levels for an upper extremity?
Amputation level is a term that describes the place where a body part is amputated,
which is determined by your doctor before the amputation procedure. The amputation
level factors into what kind of prosthesis is most suitable for the amputee. Experiencedprosthetists are usually consulted to establish what amputation level is most favorable
for your future prosthetic device. Depending on the amputation level of your upper limb,
arm, hand, and finger, prosthesis options and your ability to use certain prosthetic
technologies can vary greatly
Partial finger / partial thumb amputations
When an amputation is limited to anywhere in the finger(s) or thumb of the hand, it’s
commonly referred to as a partial finger or partial thumb amputation. It can be any finger
amputation or any combination of finger amputations. The thumb is the most critical of
all the fingers and requires the most attention for someone to achieve a normal grasp
on objects. For a partial finger or partial thumb amputation, the amputation levels could
include:
• DIP (Distal Interphalangeal Joint)
• PIP (Proximal Interphalangeal joint)
• MCP (Metacarpal Phalangeal joint)
• Joints of any one or multiple fingers
Metacarpal/transmetacarpal amputation
Metacarpal/transmetacarpal amputation refers to a removal of part of the hand, but not
the wrist joint itself. A metacarpal amputation could leave the patient with portions of
their hand and fingers still intact and a prosthetic device may or may not be needed.
You should always discuss what prosthetics options might be best suited for your
specific needs.
Wrist disarticulation
Wrist disarticulation refers to the removal of the entire hand and the wrist joint. With a
wrist disarticulation, prosthetic options can vary, but typical prosthetics will have a
socket that attaches to a variety of different terminal devices, like a hand(s) or hook(s).
Adaptors and other connecting elements are often required. With the addition of high
definition silicone gloves coverings, the entire prosthetic system can be disguised,
becoming hardly noticeable by others.
Transradial amputation
Transradial amputations are when the amputation level occurs through the radius and
ulna of the lower arm, between the elbow and wrist joint. Prosthetic options for
transradial amputations can vary tremendously, but typical transradial prostheses will
have a custom fabricated socket to intimately fit the residual limb, a forearm section that
can contain the electronics and attaches to a terminal device, like a hand or hook.Transradial prosthesis come in many different forms of devices, including passive,
body-powered, myoelectric, hybrid systems and activity specific prosthesis.
Elbow disarticulation
Elbow disarticulation is when the amputation level is at the elbow joint, and the lower
arm is removed while the entire upper arm (humerus) is maintained. Prosthetics for
elbow disarticulation typically consist of a prosthetic elbow joint in addition to a socket
(at the wrist) and terminal device(s) (hand) that attaches to the socket.
Transhumeral amputation
Transhumeral amputation is when the amputation level is through the humerus, above
the elbow. Prosthetics for transhumeral amputations commonly consist of a prosthetic
elbow joint in addition to a socket (at the wrist) and terminal device(s) (hand) that
attaches to the socket.
Several prosthetics solutions are available for this level of amputation including passive,
body-powered, myoelectric, hybrid systems and activity specific systems.
Shoulder disarticulation
Shoulder disarticulation refers to an amputation where the upper arm bone (humerus)
meets the rest of the shoulder at the clavicle and scapula. With a shoulder
disarticulation, a prosthetic system consists of a socket for the scapula and clavicle, a
prosthetic shoulder joint, a prosthetic elbow joint, a socket at the wrist, and a terminal
device (hand). Working closely with a prosthetist who understands the complexity and
has experience at fitting this level of amputation is crucial for positive outcomes. Several
prosthetics solutions are available for this level of amputation including passive, body-
powered, myoelectric, hybrid systems and activity specific systems.
Forequarter amputation
Also known as an “intrascapular thoracic” amputation, the forequarter amputation is
when the entire arm and shoulder are removed, as well as the scapula and clavicle.
With a forequarter amputation, a prosthetic system consists of a socket for the scapula
and clavicle (which could include ribs or upper portions of the trunk), a prosthetic
shoulder joint, a prosthetic elbow joint, a socket at the wrist, and a terminal device
(hand). Several prosthetics solutions are available for this level of amputation including
passive, body-powered, myoelectric, hybrid systems and activity specific systems.
Pediatric Upper Limb ProstheticsUpper extremity prosthetics for children with congenital conditions or amputations
require specialized care and attention. As children with prosthetics grow physically and
develop communication skills, they need the support and coordination of pediatric
prosthetic specialists. Pediatric prosthetics deliver the best results when combined with
consistent monitoring. Your team should work with parents and caregivers to monitor fit,
adoption, and other progress markers to make sure the prosthetic system is optimal for
your child’s needs.
The MCOP approach
For pediatric congenital amputees, our team has successfully fit myoelectric prosthetic
devices on children as young as 1.5 years old. We aim to fit the first passive arm on our
pediatric patients around the same time as the child is first able to sit, often referred to
as the “fit with sit” approach. Research shows that this is the stage of development
when children are old enough to develop the strategies necessary to use an arm
prosthetic and when they’re most likely to perceive their prosthetic as a normal and
natural extension of themselves.
After an Upper Limb Amputation
Immediately following the amputation of an upper limb, the focus will shift towards
recovery and healing of your residual limb. The recovery phase is an important step
towards starting your rehabilitation, and eventually, being equipped with an upper limb
prosthesis.
Based on the rate of your recovery, your treatment team will determine when you’ve
healed enough and when your residual limb is appropriately shaped and conditioned for
the rehabilitation stage. Only then can intensive rehabilitation processes safely begin. In
rehabilitation, you’ll learn how to properly care for your residual limb and other parts of
your body that are crucial to a full recovery. Part of the rehabilitation process also
involves being fit with a specially-tailored prosthesis (and possibly an interim prosthesis)
and learning how to use it.
What to expect after arm or hand amputation
After your amputation, the healing process begins. It might take a while to fully adjust to
life without your limb, but that’s why your treatment team is assembled. They’re there to
ensure you make a full recovery and to offer the support you need to get back to your
normal life. Early healing is all about proper bandaging, compression and keeping the
wound clean. Part of this process is a post-amputation assessment where your residual
limb, needs, and insurance options are reviewed to help you determine your best path
forward.
In-Hospital RecoveryAs with any surgery, in-hospital recovery begins in the recovery room. Immediately
following the amputation procedure, you’ll awake from the anesthesia with a drainage
tube leading out of your residual limb. This allows blood and fluid to leave the wound
and promotes healing.
How long does it take to recover from an arm amputation?
You’re likely to stay in the hospital for around 2 weeks, but your hospital stay is greatly
dependent on how your body heals and the type of amputation operation.
In the early stages, it’s also important to maintain proper positioning while in the hospital
so your muscles and joints don’t stiffen up and become less useful in the long-term. In
fact, many hospitals will recommend that you go against your natural instincts to keep
the residual limb in a comfortable, pain-free position, and instead keep it extended as
much as possible. Your treatment team might instruct you to avoid elevating the limb for
prolonged periods of time, which can also lead to lessened mobility over time.
Bandaging & Compression
Initially, your nurses or therapists will change the bandages regularly and begin showing
you how to keep it properly compressed. Compression promotes circulation and
reduces the amount of pain caused by pressure from swelling. Elastic bandages are
applied and wrapped around the skin / wound area to keep fluids from filling up in your
residual limb. Over time, you will slowly compress the wound less and less, especially if
you begin using an interim prosthesis. You’ll continue compression therapy until your
wound and residual limb are properly shaped and fully healed.
During this process, you may hear some of these bandages and elastic socks referred
to as “shrinkers” or “stump shrinkers.” This is a healthcare industry term for the post-
amputation compression sleeves.
If reusing elastic bandages, silicone compression sleeves, or similar, then you should
clean them regularly with a mild detergent or soap and allow them ample time to dry
before reapplying. Before you can wear your prosthesis regularly, you must be fully
healed with all fluids and swelling removed from the area.
Skin cleaning & care
The skin around your amputation is important because it will eventually become the
primary area in which you mount and control many movements with your prosthetic
device. Your therapist will show you how to keep it properly cleaned and moisturized to
avoid rough scaly patches of skin. Wash the residual limb with mild soap and water
twice a day. Dab it dry and apply a cream. The cream helps keep your limb soft and
pliable so it will easily accept a prosthesis.The skin on the residual limb is also likely to be very sensitive after surgery. To
decrease these sensitivities, you use a soft brush or massage ball to brush the scarred
skin and sensitive areas as much as you can tolerate it. Depending on your amputation
level, the amputation surface area should scar over within 3 to 4 weeks, but the scar
won’t be fully healed internally for quite a bit longer.
Post-Amputation Assessment
After the procedure, your team should schedule an initial clinical assessment where you
will review your residual limb, your prosthetic needs, and your insurance options to
determine your individual best path forward.
Taking Care of the Sound Arm
As you start to adjust to the new physical makeup of your upper body, you’ll begin to
rely on your non-amputated limb much more. After all, your remaining arm is now
working overtime and should naturally get stronger with the increased usage. Just as
you will focus on using your new prosthetic limb, work with your physical therapist to
condition the sound arm appropriately through exercise and muscle memory training.
You’ll not only want to start strengthening and conditioning that arm, but you should also
take care not to compromise it in any way. If you have an active lifestyle, your
prosthesis will help you get back into sports or fitness activities. Talk to your therapist
about strategies to get the most out of your prosthesis and ways to avoid injuring or
overusing your good arm.
How to Choose an Upper Arm Prosthetic
Prosthetic services can begin as soon as 2 weeks from surgery, depending on the
length of the recovery. In some cases, an immediate or early post-operative prosthetic
may be most appropriate. Ideally, you should try to begin using the prosthesis within 30
days of surgery, which allows you to more quickly adapt to using the device.Selecting Based on Lifestyle
The human arm and hand are complex structures, for each amputation level we often
recommend multiple terminal devices or multiple prosthetic devices to meet the
individual’s needs. We recommend that each individual chooses the best tool for the job
or activity in which they are involved in order to have the best possible outcomes.
Types of Arm and Hand Prosthetics
Contrary to what many people think, there are usually many different arm prosthetic
options available to upper limb amputees. Depending on a variety of factors (like the
level of amputation, your lifestyle, etc.), you have different options of prosthetics
specialized for different needs. For example, some prosthetic devices can be
customized with different attachments to allow you to continue with your favorite outdoor
hobbies, like golf or archery. The important thing to remember is that you have options
and should not settle for anything that isn’t right for you.
In many cases, we try to offer multiple prosthetic options. We consider upper limb
prostheses as “tools in a toolbox:” each patient has to choose the best tool for the job
they are engaged in.Passive prosthetics
Passive arm prostheses are the best option for people who want their prosthetic to be
functional and look more life-like. There are different options for passive prosthesis from
moderate cost PVC restorations to silicone passive prostheses that can be made out of
different qualities of silicone, either high-definition or low-definition. The high definition
silicone passive prosthesis are generally the most desirable passive prostheses. Artists
can even painstakingly reproduce and duplicate your natural skin tones in these
prostheses. While most offer limited grasping ability and the ability to pre-position the
hand, these are primarily chosen for aesthetic purposes and are not as functional as
most other options.
In addition to passive hands, some of the latest 3D-printed steel and titanium finger
technologies are proving very promising. This includes products from Point Design and
Titan Fingers from Partial Hand Solutions, which are great solutions for people with
partial finger amputations.
Body-powered prosthetics
Body-powered prosthetics are typically a prosthetic hook or hand that is operated by a
combination of the body harness, upper-body muscles and the individual’s sound limb,
all connected with a cable. Shifts in the harness and muscle tension pull on the cable,
allowing the wearer to open and close the hook or hand. Because of the way these
cable-operated prosthetics work, the wearer has the advantage of feeling feedback via
the amount of pressure they are applying through the harness and ultimately to the
hooks or hands.
The hooks and hands in body-powered prostheses come in two default states: voluntary
open and voluntary close, which refer to whether or not the device is open or closed by
default. While hands can look more natural, it’s important to consider the advantages
that hooks have. For example, hooks are especially useful for bilateral amputees and
allow easy access to pockets and bags.
Body-powered hand prosthetic for children
Externally powered (myoelectric) prosthetics
These prosthetics use microprocessors to amplify EMG signals from your muscles,
allowing you to control the wrist or hand. The term “myoelectric” is used to describe the
electrical impulses in your muscles, which are processed by the prosthetics to allow the
wearer a near-natural range of motion. These prosthetics can combine the natural look
of passive prosthetics with a high degree of functionality and control and are therefore
some of the most popular.While some of the simpler more robust versions of these devices have high grip
strength (oftentimes applying up to 20-30 pounds of force), more advanced multi-
articulating versions generally offer slightly less grip strength. Rather than strength, the
multi-articulating devices are focused on pre-programmed grasps and in conjunction
when used with advanced pattern recognition, which allows myoelectric prosthetics to
understand and execute more complex cues than traditional technologies.
Myoelectric prosthetic hand from Össur
Hybrid prosthetics
Hybrid prosthetics combine body-power and myoelectric control to give the user the
ability to control the elbow and hand simultaneously. Hybrid prosthetics often combine
the high grip force of a myoelectric device with the bio-feedback of body-controlled
devices, without extra bulk. This combination can reduce the weight and complexity of
the transhumeral prosthetic system while allowing quick operation of the elbow for
placement of the terminal device.
Hybrid prosthetic hand from BeBionic
Activity-specific prosthetics
These are devices made for a specific activity, like fishing or swimming. In addition to
prostheses fabricated for a specific activity, several common activity-specific
attachments also exist for a variety of day-to-day tasks such as brushing your teeth,
combing your hair, and more. Each activity-specific attachment easily attaches to your
existing prosthesis for use with a specific activity. MCOP generally recommends
attachments from TRS, Texas Assistive Devices or MidWest Pro-Cad, which offer great
products for almost any application.
Activity-specific prosthetic handAdvanced arm and hand prosthetics
Many companies, such as BeBionic, help people with prosthetics push the boundaries
of what they thought was possible.
Advanced Prosthetic Research and ""Experimental"" Technology
These are prosthetic devices on the cutting-edge front of prosthetic technology, relying
on the latest smart technology combined with the most advanced materials. These
include the below.
Implantable myoelectric sensors
Implantable myoelectric sensors (IMES), are implanted into specific muscles. Each
implanted electrode works with unique muscles to allow specific control of the prosthetic
hand. These electrodes allow for very fine control of externally powered prosthetics.
MCOP prosthetists were the first in the world to work with this advanced technology and
we’ve contracted with organizations to continue the research in this innovative area.The DEKA/LUKE arm
The DEKA/LUKE arm, now manufactured by Mobius, is one of the two prosthetic arms
funded through a DARPA initiative for advancing prosthetic technology. The LUKE Arm,
which was developed by Dean Kamen the developer of the Segway, is a complex
system manufactured by Mobius Bionics. The LUKE arm uses several ways to control
the function of the prosthesis. In most cases, the LUKE arm is using advanced
gyroscopic sensors to detect directional movement to control the shoulder, elbow, wrist,
and hand of the prosthesis.
Modular Prosthetic Limb
The Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) developed by Johns Hopkins-Applied Physics
Laboratory was also developed under the DARPA advanced prosthetics initiative. The
MPL is the most advanced prosthetic device in the world and can replicate all the
functions of the human arm. In most cases, the Modular Prosthetic limb uses pattern
recognition to control it. The system is being further refined to use with sensory
feedback systems to give information from the environment back to the user.
Osseointegrated prosthetics
Osseointegrated prosthetics are prostheses that use intramedullary rodding inserted
into the bone and exits the skin and the distal end of the user’s limb. The user directly
connects their prosthesis to the titanium device that exits the limb. The user does not
use a typical socket with the prosthesis which eliminates any variances in the fitting of
the prosthesis. This can be a great solution for patients with hard to fit prosthetic limbs
or who have issues with their prosthetic sockets.
HAPTIX (Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces)
HAPTIX (Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces) send nerve signals back and forth
from the terminal device. This technology is the current initiative from DARPA to
increase the control of the prosthesis integrating the prosthetic control with the user’s
neural system. The systems are designed to send and receive information from the user
to the prosthesis and prosthesis to the user. This allows for a more integrated prosthetic
system.
Choosing Advanced Prosthetic Systems
MCOP continues to be involved with several research initiatives through many different
companies and organizations. We are usually actively recruiting or looking for potential
subjects to be involved with upper limb prosthetic research projects. Subjects can often
try and give feedback on advanced prosthetic technology before it is available to the
general public. Please contact us to learn more about the research we are currentlyengaged with as these studies are constantly changing as we start and stop new
projects.
MCOP works hard to stay at the forefront of the latest in prosthetic technology, but we
know that a lot of the above can be overwhelming and sometimes it’s easier to just talk
to someone. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Do more with advanced hand prosthetics
This iLimb prosthetic hand is responsive enough to use effectively for tasks that passive
prosthetic hands would be less equipped for.
Living Without an Arm Prosthetic
Another option, of course, is to not wear a prosthetic, which we see in about half of
upper extremity amputees. Generally, if people forego a prosthetic it’s due to a bad
experience they’ve had with older technology. However, the latest advancements make
wearing a prosthetic more attractive than ever. Not only have prosthetics improveddramatically in the last few years, but not wearing a prosthetic has a number of major
drawbacks, including:
• Overuse syndromes (carpal tunnel, etc.)
• Reduced function
• Unbalanced movements resulting in back or neck pain
With our modern approaches, over 80% of patients that we fit opt to use a
prosthetic.
Weighing Your Options
If you or a loved one is considering an upper limb prosthetic you don’t have to make that
decision alone. Your team at MCOP has extensive experience in upper limb prosthetics
and we’re always happy to help. If you’re interested in getting expert support and
guidance, you can call one of the experts here. When helping you understand your
options it’s best to cover a variety of topics so that your team can get to know you
better. After that, you can schedule an initial clinical assessment where you’ll have a
specialist review your sound limb, current device, and your needs and goals so we can
help you build your best path forward.

Obtaining Insurance Coverage for Your Upper Limb Prosthetic
The next step is to navigate the pathways to obtain insurance coverage for your device.
If you have a work-related injury, your team can work with your workmen’s
compensation case manager to obtain the best device for your needs. It may be
determined that multiple devices are required to allow full function based on your goals.
Whether you have private or government insurance, VA, Tricare, or Medicare/Medicaid,
most insurance companies offer multiple options for upper extremity prosthetics.
Following this decision, prosthetic insurance experts will work to obtain pre-
authorization from your insurance regarding the products that are best suited for your
lifestyle. It is also important to have your team check your benefits to make sure that
there are no exclusions in your insurance policy.
Talk to a prosthetic insurance expertInitial Fitting of Your Prosthetic
Once the pre-authorization has been obtained, your prosthetist will order components
and have you in for an impression. For a partial hand restoration, prosthetists use
silicone. For higher level amputations, a plaster impression is usually best.
At MCOP, we prefer plaster and physical molds over digital/3D imaging because it
allows us to feel and plan for the prosthetic need – sometimes there are differing
densities, bony prominences, neuromas, and more, and we find that plaster allows us to
create the most comfortable, best fitting socket to meet your needs.
Your team will then create a test or “check” socket for you try to test comfort and range
of motion. For myoelectric prostheses, the EMG (electromyograph) sites at this stage
will be evaluated to test the strength and intensity of the signal. This is also when a
diagnostic setup of the final prosthesis should be created to determine length,
alignment, and more. This is important because once the socket is weighted with the
device, you may notice a change of fit.
Final Fitting of Your Prosthetic
Once you have a diagnostic setup that is just right, your team will fabricate a definitive,
laminated carbon fiber prosthesis. At this stage, your prosthetist would program the
upper limb prosthesis to tune the functionality to your needs. They should perform some
initial prosthetic training and work with your occupational therapist who will support your
long-term training and rehab.
Living With an Upper Arm Prosthetic
After the first fitting, you will have a follow-up 1-2 weeks later. Once you’ve worn the
prosthetic for some time, there may be some muscle or limb volume changes, and this
meeting is a chance to assess those and discuss your comfort and use of the
prosthetic. Additionally, most arm prosthetics require some level of maintenance. After
the initial follow-up, we recommend you meet every 3-6 months for routine maintenance
and follow-up.
Prosthetic Device Warranties
Each prosthetic component used in the fabrication of your prosthesis has a
manufacturer’s warranty, offering different warranty options depending on the
manufacturer and the device.Ottobock hook prosthetic
Hook prosthetics can be great for daily activities, such as tackling work or studying.
Training & Therapies
Any good prosthetist should ensure you become an expert on using and controlling the
device. One of the ways we achieve this is to work in partnership with occupational and
physical therapists to set up goals and milestones and help you achieve them through
education, physical training, and repetitive exercises. With the proper support, your new
limb will feel like a natural extension of your body as much as possible.
Putting on and taking off your arm or hand prosthesis
Your arm or hand prosthesis will undoubtedly become a routine part of your everyday
life. Though you may initially need help putting on and/or taking off the prosthesis from
your family or friends, a good prosthesis team will teach you how to do this on your own.
They will work with you on how to wear it properly and ensure the ideal fit. Your therapy
will include instructions on how to put it on so that the surface of your residual limb will
not bunch or wrinkle, which can cause skin damage and effect prosthetic fitting.
Your team will also work with you to identify signs of an improper fit, which can lead to
blisters and sores. Additionally, you’ll learn how to attach the various pieces of your
prosthetic system, how to take it off, how to use and care for any socks or siliconesleeves, and some other basic care instructions to keep your prosthetic limb and
necessary accessories functioning optimally.
Using your new prosthetic limb
Once you’re comfortable wearing it, learning to use your new prosthetic arm or hand is
the next priority. Your therapists will walk you through basic usage to help gain as much
mobility and independence as possible.
You’ll also get taught how to properly care for the prosthesis. Cleaning the surface of
the prosthetic, liners, socket, and the socket interior will help you keep the device
working properly and avoid possible skin irritations. Keep in mind that each device and
each individual varies so your usage training will be based on your unique situation. For
example, if your new limb is a myoelectric system, you’ll learn how to charge and/or
change the batteries. Some of the more advanced prosthetic devices might take a while
to learn, but that’s what your team is for!
Controlling your prosthetic
Depending on the components used in your prosthetic device, your training will teach
you how to control a number of important movements, including:
• Opening and closing the terminal device (hand)
• Rotating internally and externally
• Flexing or extending the elbow (higher level amputations)
• Flexing or extending the shoulder (higher level amputations)
With some of the more technologically advanced prosthetic systems, you’ll learn how to
control certain movements using various muscles throughout your upper body.
Myoelectric programming
Myoelectric arm and hand prosthetics are controlled by electrical signals by your
residual limb. A specialist will help prepare you to move forward with a myoelectric arm
or hand by programming the controls and responsiveness. This allows the experts to
customize the control to fit your specific needs and lifestyle so you can get the most out
of myoelectric prosthetics.
Repetitive drills
Repetitive drills are all about relearning how to do your routine activities naturally, and
with confidence, while mastering the controls of your new prosthetic. MCOP trainers
might ask you to complete certain tasks several times over again until you’re
comfortable and relaxed in doing so. With enough repetition, you’ll be able to makemovements (pouring a glass of water, driving the car, picking up small objects, etc.)
automatically without thinking about them.
Continued support
At MCOP, you’ll receive ongoing support throughout your journey forward. Among other
things, this will include reprogramming and refitting for your upper limb prosthetic. We
also have in-house occupational and physical therapists from MedStar National
Rehabilitation that help with ongoing physical therapy, but you are welcome to use
whichever therapy group you are most comfortable with. We’ll be with you every step of
the way to help you move forward.

Frequently Asked Questions
We get questions all the time. Below is a list of some of the most asked-about topics,
but if you don’t see what you’re curious about please ask about it here.
How long does it take to recover from an arm amputation?
On average, it can take from one to two months after the surgery to physically
recover from an arm amputation. Use of your new prosthetic limb may begin one week
after the amputation occurs.
How much does it cost to amputate an arm?
Costs vary depending on your hospital and insurance. Generally, it may cost anywhere
between $10,000 and $30,000 or more for a hospital to amputate an arm. If your
insurance covers it, you may end up paying between 10-20% of the total, limited by the
annual out-of-pocket maximum.How much does a prosthetic arm or hand cost?
Without insurance, you can expect to pay around $5,000 for a cosmetic prosthetic, up to
$10,000 for a functional prosthetic with a hook, and between $20,000 to $100,000 for
the latest myoelectric arm technology.
A study by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2010 gives more detail about
myoelectric prosthetics based on the level of limb loss:
• Partial loss of hand: $18,703
• Loss up to the middle of the lower arm: $20, 329
• Loss up to the middle of the upper arm: $59,664
• Loss up to the shoulder: $61,655
Note that these costs are basic estimations. Actual costs are determined by the
complexity of the desired prosthetic system. We specialize in gaining insurance
coverage for advanced prosthetics like myoelectric arms to help ease the financial
burden of a prosthetic limb.
How long does an amputation surgery take?
Most amputations require five to 14 days in the hospital. The length of the operation
itself can vary greatly and any complications may extend this timeline.
What are common causes of upper limb amputations?
Upper limb amputations are most commonly caused by trauma. Other common causes
are infections, tumors, congenital issues, and extremely poor circulation.

Tips and tricks for optimal prosthetic socket care
The maintenance of a prosthetic socket is fairly simple and straightforward, but
there are a couple of things to keep in mind.
Make sure that your patient has a good understanding of the proper care of
his/her prosthetic socket, as good maintenance will increase the longevity of the
socket and prevent any possible skin problems.
Read along for some general cleaning tips that apply to the entire Orfitrans range.
How to clean sockets and liners?
Ask your patient to clean their socket on a regular basis. The exact cleaning
schedule varies from person to person and highly depends on the season and the
climate. A warm and hot summer will ask for frequent cleaning whereas it may not
be as necessary during winter. In general, it is best to clean the socket every day
or every other day.The best time of day to clean a prosthetic socket is at night, as this leaves enough
time for the socket to dry completely. Cleaning a socket in the morning and
wearing it directly afterwards, can potentially cause the skin to swell and stick to
the walls of the socket because of remaining dampness. This could consequently
cause irritation and friction.
We recommend cleaning thermoplastic sockets and liners with a simple solution
of lukewarm water and mild soap. Stay away from any solvents or harsh cleansing
agents (e.g. acetone) as these could damage the thermoplastic material. The
socket can also be disinfected with alcohol or a solution of disinfecting soap.
It is important to rinse the socket thoroughly with warm water to remove any soap
residue.
Lastly, the socket should be dried with a towel and left to completely air-dry
overnight.
Easy donning and doffing of the prosthetic the socket
Taking off a prosthetic socket is not always an easy task, but the patient can do a
couple of things to facilitate this process. We recommend using a specialized
spray or gel to make donning and doffing easier.Advise your patient to never use talc powder on the residual limb or in the socket.
Over time, the powder will crystallise in the socket and form small grains that
could irritate the skin.
How to keep the socket feeling fresh?
It is very common for patients to sweat while wearing their prosthesis, especially
during the first few days or weeks of wear. In order to keep the socket feeling
fresh, the patient could simply take it off throughout the day and dry their residual
limb and the socket. Usually, after wearing their prosthesis for a longer period of
the time, the patient should start to notice less sweating.
Patients who still tend to sweat excessively may try using regular
antiperspirant before putting on their socket. We do advise to use antiperspirants
with caution as they may cause skin irritation for people with sensitive skin.
These straightforward and effective cleaning tips will ensure a comfortable
prosthetic fit and keep both the residual limb and the socket in great condition."

Abstract
The loss of all or part of a finger following traumatic amputation may
have a negative impact on physical and psychological well-being. An
esthetic prosthesis can offer psychological, functional, and rehabilitative
advantages. One of the major problems associated with somato-
prosthetic replacement of partially amputated finger is inadequate
retention of the prosthesis. This may stem from the weight of the
prosthesis, inadequate tissue support, and/or the particular area of the
finger to be replaced. A number of means have been employed to
enhance retention. Among the more common are adhesives, adhesive
tape, magnets and implants. The purpose of this article is to describe a
technique which eliminates the need for adhesive materials and utilizes
copper wire to fabricate a finger ring as a primary means of retention.
This technique can be utilized whenever the prosthesis encompasses
more than 180° of the affected area. This clinical report presents a case
of rehabilitation of a partially amputated index finger defect and
describes a method of retention for the same with a copper ring.

IntroductionExtra-oral defects involving the ear, eye, nose and finger are routinely
seen, amongst which finger amputation is one of the most frequently
encountered forms of partial hand loss. Such malfunctions might be due
to surgical excision for neoplastic disorders, congenital disorders such as
amniotic band syndrome or traumatic injuries [1, 2]. The missing partial
or complete finger has tremendous physical and emotional influence,
and it may affect the social well-being of an individual. A high quality
aesthetic prosthesis with passive function can be helpful to the patient.
Although microsurgical reconstruction by re-implantation or
transplantation can be attempted to restore function of many finger
defects, it may not be possible in crush and severe injuries or financial
constraints. Prosthetic rehabilitation as an alternative could be
considered in these situations to restore the digit with a functional
prosthesis with a matching form, color, and texture to enhance the
patient’s acceptance and confidence in the society [3, 4].
The ideally constructed finger prosthesis must meet the following
preconditions: the prosthesis must assist in grip and absorbing and
transferring forces to the hand; the prosthesis should look natural,
allowing expression of gestures. This case report presents the use of
copper wire to fabricate finger ring for the retention of finger prostheses.
It offers a real alternative for the reconstruction of fingers in cases where
other techniques are not applicable.

Case Report
This report describes the case of a 21 years old female patient whose left
hand index finger was partially lost, 3 years back as a result of
occupational trauma. The patient had suffered a long period of
psychological depression immediately after the injury. Post-surgery, the
patient had also observed difficulty in holding large-sized objects.
Medical history was non-contributory except she was taking anti-
depressants for many years. Clinical examination of the affected hand
revealed that remaining part of the index finger was approximately20 mm in length (Figs. 1, ,2).2). There was no evidence of hard and soft
tissue undercuts. The surrounding area appeared to be normal with no
signs of any infection over the digit. After having informed consent from
the patient, to ensure her willingness and co-operation the treatment
was initiated.Fig. 1
Partially amputated left index fingerFig. 2
Dorsal view of the index fingerBefore making impression, a thin layer of petroleum jelly was applied on
patient’s amputated finger and the adjacent area for preventing
adherence of impression material to the skin and hair. An impression of
the remaining stump was made using irreversible hydrocolloid (Alginate,
Zelgan plus, Dentsply, India) mixed with 50 % more water than normal
water in powder ratio to produce thin consistency leading to satisfactory
and optimum impression without any undue pressure over the tissue
bed. The patient was instructed to keep the hand in the normal resting
position without stretching. When the material was set the impression
was retrieved. The impression was poured in type-III gypsum product
(Kalstone, Kalabhai, Mumbai: India). At the same appointment another
impression was made of patient’s right hand index finger in a
combination of light body and putty (Express, 3MESPE, India) and wax
was poured in the negative mould for duplication of the lost finger. The
wax pattern was then adjusted by sculpting and adapted on the working
cast. The pattern was then tried on the stump and checked for the
approximate length, angulation and shape at all aspects of the index
finger.
A copper wire was adapted on the working cast out of which one end of
the wire was modified in the shape of the finger ring while the other end
was inserted into the wax pattern to ensure the sufficient retention
(Fig. 3). Test of retention and stability between the wax pattern and
finger was performed during the try-in procedure. At the same time nail
bed was prepared in the wax pattern and an appropriate size and shade
of the pre-fabricated artificial acrylic finger nail (Konad, Sravi
Enterprises) was selected for the prosthesis to look more versatile
(Diagram 1a). Beneath the cuticle margin an undercut was created to
retain the acrylic resin nail within the prosthesis. Finally the anatomic
lines were also incorporated to improve aesthetics.Fig. 3

fixation; c acrylic nail adhered to the “nail fold” and “nail wall”; d final prosthesis
After achieving the satisfactory results, the pattern was flasked. The first
pour was done until the junction of dorsal and ventral surface.
Separating medium was applied and a second pour was done to cover
the entire wax pattern so that dorsal and ventral halves of the finger was
obtained in separate flask parts to achieve better characterization with
different shades of silicone. It also eliminated the formation of unsightly
voids in the prosthesis commonly seen while using silicone, as it is more
viscous and does not flow easily into inaccessible areas. Dewaxing was
carried out routinely and the flask was allowed to cool. Medical grade
silicone RTV (Multisil-Epithetik, Bredent, Germany) was dispensed in a
ratio of 1:1 for base and catalyst paste and thickener (Multisil-Epithetik
thickener, Bredent, Germany) was added to thicken the material and to
reduce the problem of air entrapment. The base color of the prosthesis
was matched with the ventral and dorsal surface of the hand andpigments (powdered stains of different colors—red, brown, yellow,
black, and white) were mixed intrinsically to match the patient’s skin to
achieve required shade. The shade matching was carried out in natural
light between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. The base shade selected was
lighter than the highest skin tone of the patient since prosthesis darkens
with color. Color matching of the dorsal and ventral surface was done
separately. Silicone was layered into the mould and both the materials
were packed simultaneously. The moulds were closed with light
pressure applied to remove excess material. Silicone was processed at
room temperature and allowed to bench cure for overnight.
Once the final prosthesis was retrieved, the flash was trimmed using a
sharp blade and final finishing was accomplished using a silicone burs
(Fig. 4). A slit was made along the crease on the nail bed area, where
artificial acrylic nail is to be inserted (Diagram 1b). The acrylic nail was
larger than the nail bed by 2 mm proximally (edge-to edge), reducing on
the lateral borders to matching the size distally. The excess nail portion
was inserted into the slit. After the size and position of the acrylic nail
was established, the acrylic nail was un-mounted and the nail bed area
was cleaned with high pressure air to remove the debris. The nail bed
was treated with primer (Multisil-Primer, Bredent, Germany) as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines to enhance the optimal bonding between
silicone prosthesis and artificial acrylic nail (Diagram 1c, d).
Cyanoacrylate adhesive (Nail Glue, Hunan Magic Power Industrial Co.
Ltd.) was applied on the undersurface of the nail and it was positioned
such that the edges of the nail were fit inside the “slit” made along the
crease of nail bed area to achieve adequate mechanical retention
(Figs. 5, ,6).6). Nail polish was applied to make the prosthesis more
esthetic. The prostheses was inserted into the patient’s amputated index
finger and evaluated for fit [5, 6]. Instructions for home care were given
to the patient, including the debridement of the skin and cleaning of the
removable prostheses. After 3 months, further clinical reviews were
performed and no complications were found. The skin was healthy and
the retention of the finger attachment was unchanged (Figs. 7, ,8).8). The
dynamic ability of the stump was determined for some basic functions as
restoring normal length, providing opposition for the remaining digits,protecting a sensitive stump, and transmitting pressure and position
sense for activities such as writing or typing [7, 8].

Discussion
Fingers as organs of manipulation have an important role in function and
aesthetics. Moreover, for the majority of patients, the loss of the finger
can lead to psychological problems. The success of a finger prosthetic
restoration primarily depends on its retention. The most common
methods of retaining a digital prosthesis are by vacuum effect on the
stump, use of a ring at the junction of prosthesis and stump, and the use
of osseointegrated implants with customized attachments [9–11]. In this
case report, retention of the prosthesis was achieved by a vacuum effect
on the stump associated to a mechanical adaptation with adequate shape
to provide enough stability and a finger ring made of copper wire and
attached to the prosthesis. The patient could reproduce the movements
of the stump with success without displacement of the prosthesis. The
patient was highly appreciative of the social acceptance after she started
wearing the finger prosthesis. The prosthesis provided passive
functionality such as counter-support when grasping objects. The natural
appearance and customized color design meet the patient’s desire for
inconspicuousness. The vacuum effect keeps the prosthesis securely on
the residual limb without annoying closures. Thin, tapered edges
additionally improve wearer comfort. The prosthesis is also easy to clean
with water and soap; made of material that is pleasant to wear and good
fixation; prevents pressure sores, easy application and removal of the
prosthesis and enhance counter-support for existing fingers and
improved gripping function.

Conclusion
Restoration of both form and function are essential requirements for the
fabrication of finger prosthesis. The custom-made prosthesis isesthetically acceptable, partially restores some degree of function, and is
comfortable for patient resulting in psychological improvement with
personality development. The patient was well satisfied with the
prosthesis and was using it regularly."

Abstract
Individuals with lower-limb amputations may have a significant strength
deficit. This deficit may be related to the stump length and can lead to
changes in gait, reduced energy efficiency, walking resistance, altered
joint load, and increased risk of osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain.
This systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines to examine
the effects of resistance training in lower limb amputees. Interventions
with resistance training and other training methods were sufficient to
achieve muscle strength gain in muscles of the lower limbs, improved
balance, and improvements in gait pattern and speed when walking.
However, it was impossible to determine from the results whether
resistance training was mainly responsible for these benefits or even
whether the positive effects presented would be observed with only this
training method. When combined with other exercises, interventions
with resistance training made possible gains for this population.
Accordingly, it is noteworthy that the main finding of this systematic
review is that the effects may be different according to the level of
amputation, with mainly transtibial and transfemoral amputations
studied.Keywords: strength training, rehabilitation, individuals with disabilities,
adaptive physical education, training program

1. Introduction
The number of people with disabilities is increasing. For instance, the
WHO reported that 10% of the world’s population had some type of
disability in 1970, whereas approximately one billion people currently
live with some type of disability, or approximately 15% of the world’s
population (considering the 2010 estimate) [1]. In the United States of
America, 1.6 million people were living with the loss of a limb in 2005,
which could reach 3.6 million people by 2050 [2]. People with lower-
limb amputations may have a significant strength deficit. This deficit may
be related to the stump length and can lead to changes in gait, reduced
energy efficiency, walking resistance, altered joint load, and increased
risk of osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain [3].
Strength imbalances caused by amputation can be relieved through
several training programs that help to mitigate the complications caused
by amputation in these individuals [3,4]. Resistance training is an
exercise mode in which the body’s muscles move against an opposing
force. This opposite force can be achieved using equipment, such as
weights, elastic bands, machines, or even with the body’s own mass [5].
It is known that people with disabilities suffer from inaccessibility in
their daily tasks. One aim of exercise is to facilitate the practitioner’s
daily living activities. Physical exercise can be beneficial for people with
disabilities, and lack of exercise and disuse of the prosthesis are
considered reasons for the strength deficit in amputees [3]. There are
several benefits of resistance training for lower limb amputees, such as
improved walking, combatting muscle atrophy, bilateral strength deficit
reduction, increased strength for stabilization, improved gait, and
improved hip strength [4].In addition to being a public health concern, amputations can generate
significant discomfort in the lives of affected individuals. Investigating
whether resistance training can help improve the living conditions of
these individuals is essential. Furthermore, it is observed that there is a
lack of systematic reviews and practical recommendations that
contribute to a better understanding of this topic. This review aimed to
examine the effects of resistance training in lower limb amputees in
order to present practical guidance based on evidence of resistance
training protocols in this population.

2. Materials and Methods
This systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines [6]. Articles
published until March 2022 were analyzed. The search and selection of
articles took place in two stages, from August to October 2021 and from
February to March 2022.
2.1. Search Procedures and Study Selection
For the searching and selection of articles, the following databases were
used: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, VHL, Cochrane, and
Embase. The PICO strategy was used, defining the population as lower
limb amputees; the intervention as resistance training; the comparison
did not apply; and the outcome was any variable related to physical,
motor, or physiological capacity on resistance training intervention as a
primary or secondary outcome. This strategy defined descriptors in
English and was selected from the MeSH vocabulary query. The
descriptors “strength training”, “exercise program”, “strengthening
program”, “resistance training”, “exercise prescription”, “amputee”,
“amputation”, “lower limb”, and “lower extremity” were selected and
combined with Booleans, as shown in Table 1.Table 1

2.2. Eligibility Criteria
The eligibility criteria were defined according to the previously
mentioned PICO strategy. Studies were included that (I) were in
Portuguese, English, or Spanish, and (II) had the descriptors listed above
and titles that made clear the relationship with the theme of resistance
training in lower limb amputees. In case there were doubts about the
relevance of the article with the theme of the review, the abstract was
read, and if the relevance was still in question, the entire article was read
to corroborate the decision to include or exclude the study.
Articles were excluded that (I) referred only to upper limb amputations;
(II) were literature reviews; (III) were related to resistance training but
amputees were not included in their sample; (IV) were related to
amputees but not related to resistance training. Several study designs
were considered, as the intention was to examine as many studies as
possible. The search did not contain a minimum date limit and studies
published until March 2022 were considered.
2.3. Data Collection Process
A total of 156 articles were found. Table 2 shows the relationship
between the articles found and the databases.

After reading the titles, 83 articles were excluded because they did not fit
the scope of the research and 36 articles were excluded because they
were duplicates. Thirty-eight articles were selected for reading of the
abstract. After reading the abstract, 22 were excluded. From the
remainder, 16 articles were selected for a full reading. Of the 16 articles,
one was excluded due to language criteria, one was a literature review,
one did not have resistance training as an intervention, and three did not
fit the proposed theme. Therefore, 10 studies were selected for this
systematic review. Data from the articles were extracted into an
electronic card file. For a complete visualization of the data, the PRISMA
flowchart adapted for the context of this work is available below

3.1. Risk of Bias within Studies
The quality of the studies was analyzed using the TESTEX scale [7]. Table
3 displays the scores of the articles.3.2. Study Characteristics
Table 4 highlights the heterogeneity of these findings. The studies were
carried out in several countries, published between 2004 and 2021, and
most were published in the last five years [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Among
them, 90% of the studies presented amputees of both sexes. The age of
the participants varied from childhood to old age. There were different
levels of amputation among the participants. However, transtibial and
transfemoral amputees were prevalent in the studies. Regarding the
methodology, the studies showed plurality but only three (3) studies
were randomized clinical trials [11,14,15].
3.3. Exercise Approaches and Studies Results
The exercise protocols are described in Table 5. It is noteworthy that this
systematic review of the literature considered analyzing resistance
training as an intervention; however, 70% of the studies used other
techniques in addition to resistance training [8,9,10,11,14,15,16]. The
duration of the exercise protocols ranged from 3 to 20 weeks, with the
most significant number (30%) of studies lasting 8 weeks [12,14,17].
Weekly exercise frequency ranged from 1 to 3 times a week, with most
(50%) studies exercising twice a week [9,12,13,15,17]. One study did not
report the weekly exercise frequency [14] and two other studies varied
the weekly exercise frequency according to their criteria [11,16]. Studies
also reported sessions ranging from 30 min to 2 h for each training
session.
Go to:
4. Discussion
This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of resistance
training in lower limb amputees. Such studies used various analysis
techniques, training protocols, and resistance training as an intervention.
It is believed that this systematic review is the first to analyze and
compare the effects of resistance training in lower limb amputees.4.1. Studies Qualities
The poor methodological quality of the majority of the studies presented
in this review was notorious. However, it is worth noting that only three
studies were randomized clinical trials [11,14,15], which can justify the
low quality. In addition, one of the randomized clinical trials had
reasonably lower quality than the other two [14]. Interestingly, although
it was not a randomized clinical trial, one study [17] obtained the highest
score in the TESTEX scale.
The failure to present the load used in the exercise protocols, the
duration of the sessions, and the conclusion of the intervention, in
addition to whether there was any withdrawal or signaling whether or
not there were adverse effects may perhaps be the main reasons for the
low quality of the studies found, which impacted the quality of this
review. Despite the poor methodological quality, the importance of these
studies must be considered since this is a topic of interest. Furthermore,
the possible difficulty in carrying out more structured studies with this
population should be considered, given the context of inaccessibility for
people with disabilities and the particularities of each amputation.
4.2. Session Duration, Weekly Frequency, and Total Weeks (Months)
The exercise protocols ranged from 3 to 20 weeks, with 8-week
interventions being the most common [12,14,17]. Four studies lasted
less than eight weeks [9,10,13,14], while six studies lasted more than
eight weeks [8,11,12,15,16,17], of which only one lasted longer than 12
weeks, lasting a total of 20 weeks [8]. Some authors consider studies of 8
to 12 weeks to be short, which may not contribute to long-term
interventions [4]. It is noteworthy that three of the four studies lasting
less than eight weeks did not obtain significant results in at least one
outcome measure [10,13,14]. In addition, some studies of more than
eight weeks in duration presented in this review also showed little or no
significant change in any outcome measure [8,15,17], which may justify
the need for new long-term investigations.Regarding weekly exercise frequency, the importance of 2 to 3 times a
week for each muscle group in resistance exercises is observed in the
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines [18]. Seven
studies included this recommendation [9,11,12,13,15,16,17]. However,
one study did not report the weekly exercise frequency of the
intervention [14].
Regarding the duration of the sessions, some studies did not describe the
length of the sessions. Of those that presented this information, the
sessions lasted between 30 min and 2 h. The lack of such information
raises doubts about the volume of the exercise and compromises
possible replicability.
4.3. Participants
The heterogeneity of the study participants can be considered a positive
aspect, since it allows a better interpretation of different contexts.
However, this can also lead to possible errors when the results are not
specified for each type of lower limb amputation or even for each sex and
age. Another point to note is the small number of participants in each
study. Only one study contained more than fifty participants [14].
Considering studies may present different levels of amputation, sex, and
age, as well as a low number of participants, it is important to pay
attention to potentially inaccurate results.
4.4. Exercise Protocols
The exercise protocols were varied and determined by the specific
objective of the investigated studies. Unfortunately, many studies did not
present fundamental details regarding the exercise protocols. It should
be noted that the ACSM guidelines does not present guidelines for
amputees, which may have resulted in a lack of standardized guidelines
in the studies.
4.4.1. Exercise IntensityTo calculate the intensity of a physical exercise, it is recommended to use
the percentage calculation of 1RM, or another RM load, such as 10RM [5].
One study used the pre-test 10RM to define the 1RM load used in their
intervention and then 50% of 1RM was used for the weightlifting circuit
exercises [16]. According to the ACSM, exercises between 40–50% of
1RM can be beneficial for elderly and sedentary individuals [18].
In the case study [16], the individual was a 40-year-old man who was
hypertensive, a smoker, and a bi-amputee. Due to the limitations above,
exercises of 40–50% of 1RM may have been ideal in this case.
Nevertheless, the exercise program contained closed chain exercises in
addition to the weightlifting circuit, which were performed in three sets
of ten repetitions with 50%, 75%, and 100% of 10RM.
In another study [17], the intensity of 10RM was established, as they
considered it safe for patients with lower limb amputations.
Some studies did not report RM data but presented the load (kg) used in
each exercise [10,15]. Furthermore, it should be noted that only these
studies discussed exercise intensity with RM. This makes interpretation
of the data difficult and also affects the study’s replicability.
4.4.2. Number of Sets, Repetitions, and Rest Interval Length
Due to differences between the exercise protocols, the sets and
repetitions were consequently different. There was also a lack of
information about the sets and repetitions used in the studies. Rest
interval lengths of two to three minutes between sets are recommended
by the ACSM [18]. Few studies indicated the rest intervals used in the
protocols, but they ranged from one to two minutes when provided
[8,10].
4.4.3. Type of Exercises
According to the ACSM [18], several models of resistance training and
equipment can be used This review showed that different exercise
models were used with a variety of equipment. Given the particularity oflower limb amputation, it may be necessary for exercises to be adapted
so that they can be performed properly by an amputee [19,20]. Only a
few studies [9,11] made clear that the researchers adapted the exercises
for the participants. It is noteworthy that in addition to resistance
training, the exercise protocols of some studies included other training
modes, such as aerobic, flexibility, and balance exercises
[9,10,11,14,15,16]. In addition, exercises for upper limbs were also used
in some studies [16]. Furthermore, some investigations compared other
exercise techniques with resistance training [11,14,15,17]. It is
important to emphasize that using other exercise modes in the protocols
can raise doubts about the effectiveness of resistance training in the
interventions, making it impossible to affirm whether resistance training
was the only type of activity that caused the outcomes reported in those
investigations.
4.5. Resistance Training Effects
Strength deficit [3], balance-related adversities [21,22,23], changes in
gait [3,24,25,26,27], and low back chronic pain [15,28] are some of the
many problems that can accompany amputation. On this topic, the effects
of resistance training on strength deficit, changes in gait, chronic low
back pain, and adversities related to balance are reported below.
4.5.1. Strength Gains
The strength deficit may be associated with lack of exercise and disuse of
the prosthesis [3]. A study with amputee individuals demonstrated
resistance training can reduce the strength deficit in this population [28],
which is in line with some of the findings in this review [12,13,15,16,17].
Various exercise protocols using resistance training as the primary
intervention led to strength gains in amputees [12,13,15,16,17].
In a bilateral amputee, there was a more significant strength gain in the
hip of the transtibial limb compared to the transfemoral limb stem [15].
This outcome [3] corroborated the findings of another study reportingthat transfemoral amputees have a more significant deficit in their hip
muscles than transtibial amputees.
4.5.2. Fall Risk and Balance Analyses
The increased risk of falling is related to a lack of balance [22,23]. As a
result, the amputee becomes afraid of falling [21], increasing their
distrust in their ability to balance. One study [9] demonstrated an
improvement in dynamic balance during walking and an increase in
balance confidence after an exercise protocol with resistance training
and balance exercises. Likewise, another study used only resistance
training as an intervention and reported improved balance confidence
and attenuation of fear of falling [17].
In a resistance training intervention accompanied by dynamic balance
exercises, there was an increase in balance in only one foot on an
unstable surface, even without visual input and with imprecise
somatosensory feedback [11]. However, unlike previous studies, no
significant changes were seen in the activity-specific balance confidence
test (ABC test) used to examine confidence in balance. There was also no
relationship between postural control and confidence in balance.
4.5.3. Gait and Muscle Changes
When comparing the effects of resistance training with proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation technique, a significant difference in gait
patterns was reported in amputees, such as in stride length and cadence
[14]. In contrast, another study [8] found no significant changes in
walking speed and ability in two children. These results may have been
because of the low number of participants, and according to the authors,
a possible underestimation of exercise and training frequency. However,
there is no way to confirm this outcome since the study [8] lacked
fundamental information about the exercise protocol. Finally, some
investigations [10,17] demonstrated improvements in gait after training
sessions. In addition, transtibial amputees had more considerable
improvements than transfemoral amputees in relation to the gait pattern
[9].One study reported an increase in body weight in the non-amputated
limb among amputees in the control group who maintained their normal
activities [11], which can lead to postural asymmetries that can influence
gait and cause low back pain and osteoarthritis [24]. This finding
indicated that individuals who kept their normal activities maintained or
worsened their gait pattern, unlike those who engaged in resistance
training, demonstrating that resistance training may be essential to
attenuate changes in walking in this population.
Amputee individuals consume more energy when walking than non-
amputees [26]. However, after an exercise protocol in one study [15],
there was a reduction in the oxygen consumption of individuals in the
intervention group. This also occurred in a case study preparing an
amputee for a bicycle race [15]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in
this latter investigation, the participant also exercised on a stationary
bicycle in addition to resistance training. Regarding the ability of
amputees to run, one study [15] found most transtibial and transfemoral
amputees were able to run, but the bilateral amputee did not want to
attempt running in this study.
4.5.4. Chronic Low Back Pain
Many amputees suffer from low back pain [24], with one study reporting
46% of participants had chronic low back pain and 58% of these
participants were not affected by this problem prior to amputation [29].
Only one investigation sought to identify the effects of resistance training
in lower limb amputees with chronic low back pain [12]. Their findings
demonstrated resistance training can contribute to strengthening
essential muscles in the lumbar region. However, it should be noted that
studies that attempted to understand changes in gait, attenuation of the
strength deficit, and strengthening of the lumbar musculature after
intervention with resistance training may contribute to the
understanding of the topic of chronic low back pain, since changes in gait
and strength deficit are factors associated with chronic low back pain
[3,24,29].
4.6. Locomotion and AccessibilityIt is known that people with disabilities suffer from a lack of accessibility.
Some authors [30] reported one of the main difficulties in their research
was the lack of accessible transportation for participants to travel to the
intervention site. In line with this, one study [17] suggested that they
could not obtain the results of their research if assistance for the
transportation of participants was unavailable. In addition, another
investigation [31] also presented transport as a barrier to the practice of
resistance training by people with disabilities. They also mentioned that
adaptations were necessary for the training space, equipment, and
exercises. As this can be a determining factor for an intervention, it is
essential to consider accessibility and transport issues.
One of the goals of resistance training is to facilitate the practitioner’s
daily tasks [18]. In several studies presented in this review with walking
and balance as an outcome measure, an improvement in these measures
was reported after a resistance training protocol [9,10,15,17], including
visual and somatosensory limitations [11]. In addition, another aspect to
be highlighted is the study by Nolan [15] in which amputees could run
after a training protocol.
4.7. Other Results
One study demonstrated cardiovascular improvement; however,
resistance training was not the only exercise used in this study [16].
Changes in muscle tone occurred in another investigation [8].
Quality of life may be reduced after the amputation process [32,33]. Low
back pain is one of the causes that affect the quality of life of amputees
[3,34]. The findings of other studies [12] can contribute to the discussion
of this problem, in addition to other investigations that can indirectly
alleviate chronic low back pain. One study pointed to an improvement in
the quality of life of people with disabilities; however, this study was not
specifically conducted with amputees [30]. However, in contrast with
this study [30], another study reported it was not possible to identify
improvements in the amputee’s quality of life [10].
Go to:5. Review Limitations
The present work had some limitations. The varied study designs and
other exercise methods, such as aerobic exercise, in addition to
resistance training during the interventions should be highlighted. The
short duration of the studies and lack of presented information
regarding the number of sessions and their duration in some studies
were also limiting factors. The low methodological quality of the studies
should also be highlighted, including the lack of fundamental
methodological details for future replicability of the studies. Another
point that should be emphasized is the small sample size combined with
the heterogeneity of the participants, making more solid analyses
difficult.
Go to:
6. Conclusions
This systematic review aimed to analyze the effects of resistance training
in individuals with lower limb amputation by investigating whether
resistance training for this population can provide benefits or has
contraindications, as well as identify the main resistance training
strategies for this population. Interventions with resistance training and
other training methods were sufficient to achieve strength gains in
muscles of the lower limbs, hips, core, and lumbar region. In addition,
improved postural stability resulted in increased confidence in balance,
improved gait pattern and speed when walking, as well as gaining the
ability to run.
In light of the results reported in this review, it is worthwhile to note that
resistance training combined with other exercises appears to be
beneficial for this population, attenuating the strength deficit, risk of
falling, changes in gait, and chronic low back pain. However, it is
impossible to identify resistance training as the main factor responsible
for these benefits from the findings in the investigations, nor even toindicate that the positive effects presented would be observed with this
training method in isolation.
The benefits of resistance training in amputees, as well as in non-
amputees, seem to outweigh the risks. Although unusual hazards were
not found in this review, it is known that any training method can pose
risks to healthy and unhealthy practitioners. It should be noted that it
may be necessary to adapt resistance exercises to the condition of the
lower limb amputee. Facilitating access to training can also assist in
developing an effective exercise program.
Another point to consider is the need to develop new investigations,
especially studies with higher methodological quality such as
randomized clinical trials, preferably using only resistance training as an
intervention to better understand the effects of the isolated intervention.
As expected, interventions with resistance training made possible gains
for this population. Given this, it is noteworthy that the main finding of
this review is that the observed effects may differ according to the level
of amputation, with mainly transtibial and transfemoral amputations
analyzed.

7. Resistance Training Practical Recommendations for Amputees
Lower limb amputees can follow different exercise models, such as those
using free weights, circuits, weight machines, and using their own body
mass. However, closed chain exercises on weight machines should be
prioritized. Other training modes, such as balance and aerobic exercises,
should ideally be used to support resistance training. It should be noted
that it is recommended that exercises be adapted to the practitioner if
necessary. Training should be performed 2 to 3 times a week per muscle
group, with sets varying between 1 and 3 for strength gains, with 10 to
12 or 15 repetitions, prioritizing the principle of progressivity. It was not
possible to define an ideal rest period. Regarding the rest interval, wesuggest following the ACMS recommendations (2014) of two to three
minutes of rest.
It is recommended to use the 10RM test to define 1RM and the RM
percentage should be defined based on the exercise program’s
objectives. Thus, it is suggested to follow the ACSM’s recommendations
(2014); however, one should consider starting an exercise program for
this population with 40–50% of 1RM. Regarding the training objectives,
strengthening the lumbar region, hips, and lower limbs is recommended
to reduce the strength deficit. To alleviate chronic low back pain,
strengthening the lumbar region is recommended. Finally, to improve
balance and gait pattern, strengthening the muscles of the hips and
lower limbs is recommended. Table 6 contain a Resistance training
practical recommendations for amputees.

What are Amputee Exercises
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), amputation
involves surgically removing part or all of a limb. In the U.S., approximately 2 million
people have experienced limb loss. These are predominantly lower-limb amputations due
to vascular diseases like type 2 diabetes or peripheral vessel disease at over 55. An
estimated 90% have Type 2 diabetes or atherosclerosis as the cause of limb loss.

exercises that optimize your remaining muscle mass. At the same time, prevent skin
breakdown or overuse injuries. The kind of physical activity suitable for an amputee
depends largely on the extent of limb loss. The levels of lower limb amputation are:
• Symes: Forefoot or mid-foot amputation, usually preserving the heel bone
• Transtibial: Below the knee
• Transfemoral: Above the knee.
• Hip Disarticulation: Removal at the femoral hip joint• Unilateral: One limb involved
• Bilateral: Involving two limbs
For a successful exercise routine, consult a personal trainer familiar with your specific
level of amputation. They can guide you in performing beginner to advanced exercises
correctly. Activate proper muscles and do optimum exercise performance.

Building Muscle Power Through Resistance
Workouts
Resistance workouts are essential in building muscle strength and power, especially for
amputees. Engaging in exercises that challenge your range of motion and muscle
strength can significantly enhance your functional exercise capacity. When incorporating
resistance workouts, focus on exercises that utilize abdominal muscles, arm muscles, and
even prosthetic knees to improve overall muscle metabolism.
Start with lighter weights and gradually increase as your strength improves. Work on
exercises that target your maximum exercise capacity. Do all movements with proper
form to prevent injuries. An effective exercise program is a mix of functional
exercises. Mimic daily activities and specific muscle-strengthening workouts. This
combination will improve your muscle power and contribute to better mobility and
independence in your daily life.
Stabilization Workouts for Enhanced Equilibrium
For amputees, maintaining balance is a vital aspect of an active lifestyle. Incorporating
stabilization workouts into your exercise routine can significantly enhance equilibrium
and muscle balance. These exercises are particularly beneficial for knee amputees. They
address specific balance issues related to the level of amputation.
Engaging in balance exercises helps strengthen leg muscles. Improve your capacity for
exercise on fitness platforms. It’s crucial to start with basic exercises, gradually
progressing to more challenging ones as your balance improves. Consistency in amputee
practices, along with a well-structured exercise program, can lead to improved levels of
amputee balance.Flexibility Enhancing Routines
Flexibility is key to achieving optimal mobility and reaching your fitness goals. That is
especially for adult lower-limb amputees. Incorporate flexibility enhancing routines, such
as adductor stretches and aerobic machine exercises. These can significantly improve
overall flexibility and mobility for knee amputation exercises.
These routines are beneficial for extremity amputees and also add an element of fun
exercise to your regimen. Engaging in regular aerobic activity and targeted stretcheshelps lower-extremity amputees regain range of motion. Promote better functionality of
the prosthetic limb. By dedicating time to flexibility exercises, you’re actively working
towards your mobility goals.
Heart-Pumping Workouts
Heart-pumping cardio exercise is vital for amputees to maintain cardiovascular health
and build human muscles. Engaging in the right form of exercise tailored to your
achievable goals is key to success. Use custom prosthetics to your advantage during
training regimens. You’re supported the entire time.
Cardiovascular workouts strengthen the heart and also enhance the functionality of
your prosthetic limb. These exercises, combined with strength and flexibility training,
create a holistic approach to fitness and mobility. Let’s get our hearts pumping!
Amputee Exercises for a Stronger Upper Frame
Building a stronger upper frame is essential for amputee patients. Provide stability and
support for daily activities. Core exercises are a fundamental part of this training. They
engage and strengthen the core muscles, which act as the body’s powerhouse.
Incorporate a variety of core exercises into your routine. Develop a solid foundation that
supports your upper frame. This, in turn, will enhance your overall functionality and
mobility. Lift, reach, or move throughout your day. A strong core and upper frame will
empower you to do so with ease and confidence.

EXERCISE AND FITNESS FOR AMPUTEES,"EXERCISE AND FITNESS FOR AMPUTEES
Amputations
An amputation does not prevent an individual from taking up or continuing to exercise
and keep fit. When it comes to taking part in sport, physical activity and exercise,
amputees and individuals with limb impairments have similar options as those without -
although some modifications may need to be made to enable participation.
Here, we provide some advice for exercise and fitness for amputees to help you keep
fit.
WHY IS EXERCISE GOOD FOR YOU AFTER
AN AMPUTATION?
If you are fitted with a prosthesis, your body will experience a negative force on the
muscles and skeleton, which, if left uncontrolled, will eventually cause posture changes.
This, in turn, affects how your muscles perform causing the following:
• Weakness and a strain on ligaments
• Loss of balance
• Aches and pains in the joints
Exercise helps you to stay more symmetrical, preventing your amputation side from
becoming weak and inactive and forcing other parts of your body to overcompensate
and become overused. The fitter you can be following an amputation, the better your
body will cope with a prosthesis as you will have more control over your body. This will
help to make daily tasks easier to accomplish.
Other benefits of exercising include:
• Improved well-being and reduced stress
• Lower cholesterol and blood pressure
• Reduced risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease
• Weight management
• Better breathing
• Increased strength and endurance• Improved range of movement and joint mobility
• Injury prevention
MY FITNESS JOURNEY - JAMIE GANE
I have always loved sports, but due to my chronic pain condition, which started at the
age of nine, I was unable to participate in sport with my peers. When I started looking at
amputation as a viable option for my pain, I realised that I would need to be as fit and
healthy as possible. I started to look at wheelchair racing, but then I found throwing
sports.
Once my amputation was completed and I could walk, I couldn’t stop myself from
running, obstacle racing and getting back into Judo, which I had started at a very young
age. I began competing on the international stage for Jude and obstacle racing, winning
the silver medal at the World Judo Games, which placed me second in the world for my
Judo category.

AMPUTATION
As an amputee, you may face a number of barriers to physical activity that can make
becoming and staying active a real challenge. Here are a few common barriers and how
you can try to overcome them:“I don’t know where to start”
“I don’t have the time”
“I can’t find a local facility with accessibility”
“I feel too tired to exercise”
“I’ve never been good at exercise or sport”
STARTING OUT IN EXERCISE OR SPORT AS
AN AMPUTEE
If you are new to exercise as an amputee, or returning after a break, you should seek
advice from your prosthetic centre or a healthcare professional, such as your GP or
physiotherapist. They should be able to provide you with advice regarding how much
physical exercise and activity is appropriate for you in the early stages. Be prepared to
modify an activity or exercise if you need to, but remember, nothing is off limits.
Amputee and prosthetist Jim Ashworth-Beaumont said: “Previously I was a keen
weightlifter, but now I’m focusing on different types of exercise than I did before.
Likewise, I’ve now got into adaptive sport. You only have to look at the Paralympic
events to see that sport is about ability, never about disability.”
Your prosthetist or physiotherapist should be able to help you create an initial exercise
programme based on using and not using your prosthesis to give you a variety of starter
activities.
Mark Smith said: “For many people, the hardest part of starting exercising is the aches
and pains in the first few weeks, but once you start to see and feel benefits, it becomes
addictive - in a good way!”
“There’s a real sense of community within sport - whatever sport you may find.”
- Jamie Gane, Adaptive Athlete
You will not need a sport-specific prosthetic to exercise as your everyday leg should
cope with most activities. Once you are fit and exercising regularly, or taking part in
sport more often, you may find that your prosthesis is holding you back, which is when
you should speak to your prosthetist.Jamie Gane said: “One of the hardest parts of keeping fit with an amputation is finding a
prosthetic that works for you, as well as the fit. Once you have a good prosthetist and
prosthetic, you’re away!”
It is important to remember that keeping fit is a marathon, not a sprint, so if you can only
do five minutes at first, don’t worry. The great thing about exercise is that you can work
your way up, meaning you can start slow and take into account your current ability level
(i.e. strength, stamina and stability). A common mistake many people make when
working out is being too aggressive in the early stages and burning out. Listen to your
body and if it doesn’t feel right, stop what you’re doing immediately.
MY FITNESS JOURNEY - MARK SMITH
My fitness journey started after losing my leg while serving in the British Army. Wanting
to find a purpose and something challenging, I initially wanted to step on a bodybuilding
stage, as a way to grow in confidence. If I could stand on stage missing a leg and be
critiqued, then I could do anything.I was very lucky to win several bodybuilding shows, my highlight was sharing a stage
with Phil Heath in the States. To test myself further, I then stepped into disabled
strongman competitions, winning Britain’s Strongest Disabled Man twice in 2016 and
2017, winning the Arnold Classic twice in 2017 and 2018, and winning England’s
Strongest Disabled Man in 2018.
I always wanted to return to my first love of football at some point though, and, in
January 2019, I started playing amputee football for Peterborough United Amputees,
which was football played on crutches without the prosthetic leg.
It has been life-changing, particularly winning the national league title in my first season.
I am now in my third season with Peterborough and I absolutely love it.
To keep up with Mark’s latest updates, take a look at his Instagram here.WHAT EXERCISE SHOULD I DO?
To maintain your health and fitness following an amputation, you need an exercise
regime that you will enjoy and is convenient for you. Any exercise programme should
contain elements that address strength, balance, posture, coordination and
cardiovascular fitness.
Jamie Gane said: “Exercising with an amputated limb can be very similar to a biological
limb. You find exercises that are tailored to the muscle groups that you do have. Justbear in mind that you may have to lower the weights and really focus on those targeted
muscle groups. Once you have settled with an amputation, there’s really no type of
exercise that isn’t either accessible or able to be adapted.”
Here, we take a look at some of the common types of exercise used by amputees:
YOGA/PILATES
Try to do the exercises as normal, as prosthetic restrictions will be apparent. You should
group together any positions that you may wish to remove your prosthesis to avoid
taking it off and putting it on too much.
Be mindful of your posture throughout the exercise - use a mirror perhaps to ensure that
you do not twist out of position.
STRETCHING
Advice suggests you should perform a top-to-toe stretch twice a week, as well as any
stretches given to you by your physiotherapist. Stretching helps to realign the skeleton
and lengthen your muscles, which keeps you flexible. You may need to modify some
stretches to accommodate a prosthesis.
BALANCE AND COORDINATION
Exercises for balance and coordination should help you to ‘feel’ your prosthesis (i.e.
sense where it is and how you are standing on it). Speaking about the differences
between exercising with and without a prosthesis, Mark Smith said: “The differences
can be balance when it comes to squats and deadlift, but core stability helps a lot.”
STRENGTHENING
There are a number of strengthening exercises that you can carry out in the gym and at
home, including:
• Upper and lower limb weights
• Stair climbing leg over leg
• Wall sitsMost gym equipment, such as cycling and step machines, will be fine to use with the
exception of hamstring curls and quadricep leg extensions if you’re wearing a leg
prosthesis. Mark Smith said: “Anything can be adapted for an amputee to train in the
gym, some exercises may require improvising slightly, but on the whole, everything is
still possible in the gym”.
Strength sessions should be repeated twice a week.
CARDIOVASCULAR
When it comes to cardiovascular fitness, you should aim to increase your heartbeat for
about 30 minutes - this could be made up of a mixture of exercises. Swimming, cycling,
treadmill walking, walking outdoors with walking poles, stepper machines and rowing
are all good forms of cardiovascular exercise for amputees. Running is not the best way
to keep fit following an amputation if there is an alternative.
Remember, high-impact exercise can cause trauma to the skin in your socket after a
while, such as bruising and blisters, so make sure to monitor your capability.
Cardiovascular exercise should be carried out five times a week, but housework,
dancing, shopping, dog walking, gardening and other daily activities could make up part
of your routine."

Exercising When You Have an Upper Limb Difference,"Exercising When You Have an Upper Limb
Difference
by Amber Henson
2 min read
Jan 10, 2023
There are three general types of exercise we’ll be exploring in this article:
endurance, strength and balance/flexibility. Each type of exercise has options
for people with an upper limb difference however, performing repetitive
movements without both limbs can result in balance and overuse issues.
Ideally, exercise should be performed with proper body mechanics and a
balanced posture to prevent injury. The best way to achieve this is to use aprosthesis while exercising. For many exercises, an activity-specific device is
an ideal tool that’s designed to safely support that particular exercise.
Endurance
Several types of endurance exercises can be performed outside of a gym.
Walking is a great, low-impact way to get many of the health benefits of
movement, especially if you keep up the pace. You can walk and run without
an upper limb prosthesis, but you may find that your body is more balanced
when wearing one. Dancing and swimming are other excellent options. You
can see an activity-specific swimming prosthesis in the video below:
Biking and yardwork are other noteworthy endurance exercise options.
Strength
A strong, muscular body can help you maintain an independent lifestyle.
Weightlifting and meeting personal fitness goals can also be an ego boost
after an amputation. We have three patient profile videos that feature our
patients weightlifting at the gym: Max Okun, Wendi Parker and Claudia
Castellanos. We also have a blog article on the subject, Weightlifting with an
Upper Limb Prosthesis.
Balance/Flexibility
Tai Chi and yoga provide excellent exercise and promote mindfulness and
breathing practices that help with pain management.
Our patient Angel Giuffria is a fan of yoga, and you can see her using her
activity-specific device for many of her poses in her patient profile video
below:
What exercises would you like to get back into or try for the first time?
Our holistic approach to prosthetic care means your goals are our goals. We
collaborate with our patients to determine what activities are most meaningful
to them so we can create a prosthesis and prosthetic care plan to meet a
person’s goals. Additionally, many of our prosthetists and clinical therapyspecialists have been able to join their patients at the gym, swimming pool or
yoga studio to observe and give tips about proper body mechanics. If the
prosthesis isn’t working for our patient in the environment they want to be in,
we want to fix it!

Treatment varies depending on the severity and location of the injury, and the health of
the patient.
An injury or amputation can damage any part of the fingertip, including:
• Skin and soft tissue
• Fingertip bone (distal phalanx)
• Nail and underlying nailbed
The tips of longer fingers tend to be injured more often because they are last to escape
from harm's way.
Your fingertips are rich with nerves and are extremely sensitive. Without prompt and
proper treatment, a fingertip injury can cause problems with hand function and may
even result in permanent deformity or disability. To ensure the best outcome, it is
important to have your doctor examine your finger or thumb soon after an injury.

First Aid
If you have injured your finger, do the following as you are preparing to go to the
emergency room or see your doctor:
• Clean the injury with clean water or saline solution, if possible, and cover it
with a lightly compressive sterile dressing to minimize bleeding and protect
the injured finger.
• Elevate the injured hand so that it is higher than your heart to minimize
swelling.
• Immobilize the affected hand and wrist with a short splint.
If your fingertip is completely cut off, do the following:
• Gently clean the amputated part with water or, if possible, with sterile
saline solution.
• Cover it in a moistened gauze wrap.
• Place it in a sealed watertight bag, making sure there are no tears in the bag
that could let water in.
• Place the bag on ice in a sealed container or another watertight bag.
• Do not allow the amputated part to be in direct contact with ice. You could
damage it further.
• Go immediately to the emergency room, preferably at a hospital that has
hand specialists immediately available.
Bring the amputated part with you to the emergency room and guard it carefully until
the doctor is able to evaluate you.

Doctor Examination
Medical History
Your doctor will talk with you about your medical history and the circumstances of your
injury. They will want to know:
• Whether you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes
• Whether you smoke
• Whether you take any medications
• Whether you have experienced a previous injury to the affected hand
To help plan your treatment, your doctor will ask several questions. These may include:
• How and when did your injury occur?
• Is the injured finger on your dominant hand?
• What do you do for a living?
• What are your recreational activities?
• Do you smoke or use tobacco products?• Have you ever had hand problems caused by osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
arthritis, diabetes, or any other medical condition?
• Is your tetanus immunization up-to-date?
Physical Examination and Immediate Care
Your doctor may give you a numbing injection (digital block anesthesia) to help reduce
the pain in your injured finger. They will irrigate, or wash out, your wound with a saline
solution to see it more clearly and to reduce the risk of infection.
Your doctor will examine your finger carefully, looking for:
• Exposed bone
• Missing tissue
• Injury to the nail and nailbed
Your doctor will then thoroughly clean out the wound, removing dead tissue and
contaminants. This procedure, called ""ebridement, will reduce your risk for infection.

Infections
If your doctor suspects that you have broken bones, they may order X-rays. Some
fingertip injuries can cause bleeding under the fingernail — a condition called subungual
hematoma. If this is the case with your injury, your doctor may pierce your fingernail to
relieve the pressure. They may also remove your fingernail if the nailbed underneath
requires repair.
Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic and/or give you a tetanus shot to prevent
infection.

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to have a pain-free fingertip that is covered by healthy skin and
functions normally. Your doctor will try to preserve the length and appearance of your
finger.
Treatment for a fingertip injury or amputation depends on the angle of the cut and the
extent of the injury. To determine the best treatment for your injury, your doctor will
consider your general health and lifestyle, as well as your preferences.(Left) Wounds made along the green lines will probably heal on their own. (Right) Wounds
made along blue lines will probably need some sort of surgery to heal.
Injury Without Exposed Bone
Minor tissue injury. If your fingertip wound is small and not deep enough to expose
bone, it may heal on its own.
• Your doctor may place a protective dressing over the wound with
instructions to change the bandage regularly.
• They may recommend that you wear a splint to protect the area while it
heals.
• Your doctor may recommend that after 1 to 2 days, you soak your finger
daily in a solution of warm, soapy water or saline solution with peroxide or
betadine.
• After 2 days, you may start range-of-motion finger exercises to avoid
stiffness.
• Complete healing usually takes 2 to 4 weeks, although stiffness and
hypersensitivity (extreme sensitivity) may remain longer, depending on the
severity of the injury.Larger tissue injury. If your fingertip wound is large and open, there may not be enough
remaining skin to heal and cover the open area.
In some cases, the wound may be left open to heal gradually on its own.
Sometimes, surgery may be required to ensure healing. Surgical procedures used to
treat larger tissue injuries may include:
• Skin grafting. In this procedure, a piece of skin (skin graft) is taken from the
outside of your hand, your forearm, or another area of your body and used
to cover the injury. Both the wound and the donor site are closed with
stitches during the procedure.
• Reconstructive flap surgery. Because a skin graft does not have its own
blood supply, it may not be sufficient for some larger tissue injuries. If this
is the case, your doctor may take a full-thickness flap of skin (the skin, plus
the fat and blood vessels underneath) from a healthy part of your injured
hand and use it to cover your wound. This procedure is discussed in greater
detail in the section below.
Exposed Bone Injury
For injuries that expose the bone, there may not be enough tissue around the wound to
stitch the wound closed. Sometimes, the bone needs to be shortened so that your wound
can be stitched closed. Shortening the bone slightly usually does not hurt your ability to
use your hand.
Reconstructive flap surgery. It may be necessary to cover the wound with new skin, as
well as the fat and blood vessels underneath the skin. This is called reconstructive flap
surgery.
The flap of skin and soft tissue is often taken from a healthy part of the same hand.
Common donor areas are the injured finger itself, a non-injured finger, and the palm of
the hand. A skin graft may be used to cover the donor area and to help it heal.
In some cases, the flap is not fully removed from the donor area. The flap is sewn over
the wound but remains connected to the donor area (see illustration below). This is
done to ensure a healthy blood supply to the flap as it heals over the wound. It typically
takes a few weeks for the flap to heal over the wound and establish a blood supply from
its new location. When this occurs, the flap will be detached from the donor area.In some reconstructive flap surgeries, the flap remains attached to the donor site during
healing.Reproduced from Frassler PR: Fingertip Injuries: Evaluation and Treatment. J Am Acad Orthop Surg
1996;4:84-92.
Your doctor may apply a bulky dressing to protect the area while it heals. They may also
apply a splint to help support your hand. Most of your uninjured fingers will be left free.
Replantation. If your injury has cut off a large part of your fingertip, your surgeon may
consider the pros and cons of reattaching the amputated part. This is called
replantation.
Replantation is a complicated surgical procedure during which blood vessels are
repaired to allow both the inflow and outflow of blood to the amputated part. A
replantation can require significant recovery time for the patient. Depending on the type
of amputation and the health of the patient, replantation may not always be possible or
appropriate.
Fingertip Amputations in Young Children
Doctors treat fingertip amputations somewhat differently in children younger than 6
years of age. After thoroughly cleaning and preparing an amputated fingertip, the
surgeon may reattach it to the finger. The fingertip may continue to grow relatively
normally, even if bone was exposed. This is especially possible in children younger than
2 years of age.
Your child's doctor will consider many things when determining whether to reattach
your child's amputated fingertip, including:
• Your child's age and general health
• The condition of the amputated part
• How the injury occurred.
Complications
In many cases, surgery can return a large degree of feeling and function to a fingertip
injury. However, there are potential complications associated with both the injury itself
and surgery for fingertip injuries. Your doctor will discuss each of the risks with you and
will take specific measures to help avoid potential complications.
Possible risks and complications include:
• Infection
• Poor wound healing
• Persisting numbness or hypersensitivity
• Stiffness
• Abnormal nail growth
• Loss of viability (usability) in the amputated part
• Neuroma, or pain while the nerve is healing after the injury• Bad reaction to anesthesia
Outcomes
Full recovery from a fingertip injury may take several months. After your injury heals,
mild to severe pain and sensitivity to cold may continue for up to a year or may even be
permanent.
Your doctor or a hand therapist may recommend specific exercises to improve range of
motion and strengthen your hand and fingers. They may also suggest additional
therapies to help promote healing and function. These therapies may include:
• Heat and massage
• Fingertip desensitization
• Electrical stimulation of the nerves in the hand
• Splinting
• Special compression wrappings to control swelling
• Activities to improve fine motor skills such as pinching and grasping
Most patients with fingertip injuries end up with good results. Even patients with partial
loss of fingers tend to function quite well after a period of healing and adjustment."
Fitness Goals,"Fitness Goals: Workouts & Stretches For
Amputees
Fitness goals are important for everyone, and amputees are no exception. Many
amputees face unique challenges when it comes to physical activity and exercise, but
with the right mindset, resources, and support, they can achieve their fitness goals just
like anyone else. At Horton's Orthotics & Prosthetics, we specialize in fitting prosthetics,
which helps amputees lead active, healthy lives through the use of custom prosthetics.
In this article, we'll provide some tips and resources for amputee exercises specifically
designed to help amputees achieve their fitness goals.
Before starting any new exercise program, it's important to consult with a healthcare
professional to ensure that it's safe and appropriate for you. This is especially true for
amputee exercises, who may have additional considerations to take into account. Once
you have the green light to start exercising, it's important to set achievable goals and
work up to them gradually. This will help you stay motivated and prevent burnout or
injury. It's also important to listen to your body and take breaks as needed. It's okay to
start small and gradually increase your intensity and duration as you become more
comfortable and confident with your workouts.Photographer: daniel odame | Source: Unsplash
Amputee Exercises
There are many different types of exercises that can be beneficial for amputees. Here
are a few examples:Cardio
Cardio exercise, such as walking, jogging, cycling, or using an elliptical machine, can
help improve cardiovascular health and increase endurance. Cardio workouts can also
help reduce stress, improve sleep, and boost mood. Amputees may need to modify
their workouts to accommodate their prosthetics or other limitations, but there are
many ways to do so. For example, you might try using a stationary bike instead of a
treadmill if you have difficulty running, or you could use hand cycles or upper body
ergometers if you have a lower extremity amputation.
Strength Training
Strength training can help improve muscle tone and bone density, which can be
especially important for amputees who may have lost some muscle mass due to their
amputation. Strength training can also help improve balance, stability, and overall
physical function. You can use free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises
to work your muscles. Again, you may need to modify your workouts to accommodate
your prostheses or other limitations. For example, if you have an upper extremity
amputation, you might use a leg press machine instead of a bench press.
Upper Body Exercises
If you have a lower extremity amputation, you may want to focus on exercises that
target your upper body muscles. These could include exercises such as push-ups,
bench press, shoulder press, rows, and bicep curls.
Leg Exercises
If you have an upper extremity amputation, you may want to focus on exercises that
target your leg muscles. These could include exercises such as squats, lunges, leg
press, and calf raises.
Core Exercises
Strong core muscles are important for balance and stability, and there are many
exercises that can help strengthen your core. These could include exercises such as
planks, sit-ups, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches.
Balance ExercisesBalance exercises can help improve coordination and prevent falls. These could include
exercises such as standing on one foot, walking on a balance beam, or using a stability
ball.
Yoga
Yoga is a low-impact form of exercise that can help improve flexibility, balance, and
mindfulness. Yoga can also help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. There
are many adaptive yoga classes and resources available for amputees, which can help
you modify poses to suit your needs.
Stretching
Stretching is important for maintaining flexibility and range of motion. It can also help
reduce muscle tension and improve overall physical function. There are many
stretching exercises that can be modified for amputees. For example, if you have a
lower extremity amputation, you might use a wall or a chair to support your balance
while stretching your upper body or legs.
Overall Health
In addition to these amputee exercises, it's also important to focus on overall health
and wellness. This includes eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and taking
care of your mental health. Exercise can be a great way to improve your overall
physical and mental health, but it's just one piece of the puzzle.
Conclusion
At Horton's Orthotics & Prosthetics, we understand that every amputee is unique, and
we are committed to providing customized solutions to help you achieve your fitness
goals. If you're an amputee looking to improve your physical health and well-being, we

Practice Pattern:
4J: Impaired Gait, Locomotion, and Balance and Impaired Motor Function Secondary to Lower
Extremity Amputation. Other Practice Patterns may be applicable as well.
ICD 9 Codes:
84.1, 84.3, 84.13, 84.14, 84.15, 84.16, 84.17
This standard of care applies to any patient after a lower extremity (LE) amputation, including
transfemoral (above-knee amputation or AKA), transtibial (below-knee amputation or BKA),
transmetatarsal amputation (TMA), and toe amputations. This standard of care is intended to serve
as a guide for clinical decision-making for physical therapy management of this patient population
for Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) physical therapy services.
Limb amputation results in significant changes in body structures and functions. There is the
physical loss of a body part as well as the closely related effects of the underlying disease,
comorbidities, and concurrent injuries1. Prosthetic fitting may compensate for the loss of body
structures and function of the affected limb(s). Persons with amputations may also experience a
wide range of activity limitations and participation restrictions. Typical activity limitations and
participation restrictions for lower extremity amputees relate to self-care activities and mobility.
These affect the ability of the person to return to and maintain work, maintain social relationships,
participate in leisure activities and be active members of the community1. Environmental factors
such as barriers in the community related to physical/structural environments, as well as personal
factors such as age, sex, level of education and ability to adjust, may restrict participation in
normal social roles for persons with lower extremity amputation1.
An important basis for optimal acute and long-term physical therapy management of amputees is
an in-depth understanding of the patient and the functional consequences of the amputation,
systemic and detailed consideration of the patient and their environment, and sound measurement
of functional outcomes1.
Prevalence of amputations internationally has been reported as 17-30 per 100,000 persons1. Non-
industrialized countries generally have a higher incidence due to a higher rate of war, trauma, and
less developed medical systems1. Trauma is the most common cause of amputations in non-
industrialized countries1. The continued high levels of conflict worldwide, including continued use
of land mines and increased use of motorized transportation, will result in an increasing prevalence
of persons with an amputation globally, equating to an increase in the number of persons with
chronic disabling conditions1.
In the U.S., limb amputations due to dysvacular causes such as peripheral vascular disease (PVD),
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) account for 82% of all lower
extremity (LE) amputations2. Other causes of LE amputations are trauma (16.4%), cancer and
malignancies (0.9%), and congenital deficiencies (0.8%)2. From 1988-1996 the rates of
dysvascular amputations in the United States increased 26.9%, while rates of cancer and trauma-
related amputations decreased 42.6% and 50.2%, respectively2. Risk of amputation increases with

blacks requiring dysvascular amputations2. Males are at a significantly higher risk for trauma-
related amputations than females2. The leading causes of trauma-related amputations have been
reported to be injuries involving machinery (40.1%), powered tools and appliances (27.8%),
firearms (8.5%), and motor vehicle crashes (8%)3.
The language used in this standard is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF). The International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, also known as ICF, is a classification of
health and health-related domains. These domains are classified from body, individual and societal
perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of
activity and participation. Since an individual’s functioning and disability occurs in a context, the
ICF also includes a list of environmental and personal factors. For more information on this type of
documentation please refer to your mentor or reference material available in the department or on-
line at the World Health Organization’s web page.
http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/
Indications for Treatment:
This standard of care applies to any new lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease,
diabetes mellitus, trauma, infections, presence of tumor, or other limb deficiencies. It also applies
to any new admission for persons who have had a previous lower extremity amputation and are at
risk for edema, weakness and/or contractures due to medical issues necessitating admission to
BWH.
Types of Lower Extremity Amputation and Considerations4, organized by anatomical location,
distal to proximal:
1. Toe Amputation:
• Phalangeal or partial toe amputation involves excision of any part of one or more of the
toes.
• Common, account for 24% of DM amputations.
• Prosthesis is not usually necessary.
• Patients’ may have weight-bearing restrictions, the Physical Therapist needs to clarify
with surgical team.
• In dysvascular cases where neither pain nor infection is a concern, auto-amputation can
be awaited5.
2. Transphalangeal Amputation (Toe Disarticulation):
• Amputation done at the metatarsophalangeal joint.
• May result in biomechanical deficiencies:
o Amputation of great toe affects push-off during fast gait and running, and may result
in a non-propulsive gait pattern.
o If the base of the proximal phalanx with the insertion of the flexor hallucis brevis is
saved, stability is enhanced.
o Second-digit amputation results in severe hallux valgus.
3. Transmetatarsal Amputation (TMA):
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 3
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.• Foot amputation in which a dorsal incision is made through the mid- to proximal
metatarsal shafts, and a long, thick myocutaneous plantar flap including the flexor
tendons is used, with closure of this flap onto the dorsum of the foot.
• There are approximately 10,000 TMA’s performed each year in the U.S.
• Patients’ may have weight-bearing restrictions. The Physical Therapist needs to clarify
these restrictions with the surgical team.
• Once incision is healed and the patient is ambulatory, they may require a prosthetic
orthosis (rocker-bottom sole and a polypropylene ankle-foot orthosis (AFO)) to offset
increased weight-bearing load on remaining tissues.
4. Lisfranc Amputation:
• Performed at the tarsometatarsal joint and involves disarticulation of all five metatarsals
and digits.
• Uncommon
• Often result in an equinus and varus deformity due to the pull of the plantarflexors and
loss of dorsiflexor and peroneal muscles.
5. Chopart Amputation:
• At the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints, it involves disarticulation through the
midtarsal joint leaving only the calcaneus and talus.
• Uncommon
• Often result in an equinus and varus deformity due to the pull of the plantarflexors and
loss of dorsiflexor and peroneal muscles.
o For Lisfrac, Chopart and transphalangeal amputations, orthotic shoe fillers or shoe
modifications may be used, such as a spring-steel shank extending to the metatarsal
heads, and a rocker sole or padding to the tongue of the shoe to assist in holding the
hindfoot firmly in the shoe.
6. Syme Amputation:
• Ankle disarticulation in which the heel pad is kept for good weight-bearing.
• Thick heel pad can allow direct weight-bearing.
• Post-operative complications may include an unstable heel flap, development of neuroma
of the posterior tibial nerve, and poor cosmesis.
• Patients are typically kept non-weight-bearing (NWB) immediately post-op.
• Uncommon
7. Transtibial Amputation (BKA):
• Very short transtibial amputation occurs when less than 20% of tibial length is preserved.
o May result from trauma, and not usually an elective procedure.
o Results in small-moment arm, making knee extension difficult.
• Standard Transtibial Amputation occurs when between 20% and 50% of tibial length is
preserved.
o At least 8cm of tibia is required below the knee joint for optimal fitting of a
prosthesis.
• Long Transtibial Amputation occurs when more than 50% of tibial length is preserved.
o Usually not advised due to poor blood supply to the distal leg.
• Long posterior flap is normally used because of good vascularization and it provides an
excellent weight-bearing surface.
• Fibula is usually transected 1-2cm shorter than the tibia to avoid distal fibula pain.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 4
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.• Transtibial amputations have been reported to account for 27.6% of dysvascular
amputations performed in the U.S.2.
8. Knee Disarticulation (Through-Knee Amputation or TKA):
• Old and anatomic procedure which does not require surgically cutting through bone or
muscular bellies.
• Offers good weight distribution and retains a long, powerful femoral lever arm.
• Yields a non-cosmetic socket due to need for an external joint mechanism and resultant
difficult swing-phase control.
• Often performed on patients who will not become a prosthetic walker, or in growing
children to maintain femoral length.
9. Supracondylar Amputation:
• Surgical procedure in which the patella is left for better end weight-bearing.
• Area between the end of the femur and patella may delay healing.
10. Transfemoral Amputation (AKA):
• Short transfemoral amputations occur when less than 35% of the femoral length is
present.
o Uncommon
• Medium transfemoral amputations occur when between 35% and 60% of femoral length
is preserved.
o In general, the residual limb must be at least 4 to 6 inches in length from the groin to
fit a prosthesis6.
o Ideally, amputations should be at least 4 inches (10cm) above the lower end of the
femur to allow room for the prosthetic knee.
o Normally, anterior and posterior muscular surfaces are well vascularized, so equal
flaps are used.
• Long transfemoral amputations occur when more than 60% of femoral length is present.
• Transfemoral amputations have been reported to account for 25.8% of dysvascular
amputations performed in the U.S.2.
11. Hip Disarticulation:
• Involves loss of all the femur
• Uncommon
• Usually done in cases of malignant tumors, extensive gangrene, massive trauma, or
advanced infection.
12. Hemipelvectomy:
• Involves loss of any part of the ilium, ischium, and pubis.
• Uncommon
• Can be internal, in which the limb is salvaged, or external, in which the limb is removed.
External hemipelvectomy may also be referred to as a transpelvic amputation.
• Usually done in cases of malignant tumors, extensive gangrene, massive trauma, or
advanced infection.

Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.Stages of Amputee Rehabilitation7:
Rehabilitation after major lower extremity amputation can be divided up into nine specific periods
of evaluation and intervention, each with its’ particular set of treatment goals and objectives7.
Communication among the interdisciplinary healthcare team, the patient, and with the patient’s
family is essential. Each stage entails specific treatment objectives listed below, but care should be
focused on individual treatment goals based on the patient’s health status, level of amputation, and
relevant personal and environmental factors.
I. Preoperative – Involves medical and physical assessment, patient education, functional
prognosis, discussion about phantom limb pain, realistic short and long term goals.
• Optimal rehabilitation care of the amputee begins, if feasible, prior to the amputation8.
• If possible, patient should be placed in a cardiopulmonary conditioning program. 7.
II. Amputation Surgery/Dressing – Involves surgical residual limb length determination, closure of
wound and soft-tissue coverage, nerve management, dressing application, and limb
reconstruction.
• The residual limb must be surgically constructed to optimize the intimacy of fit of future
prosthesis, maintain muscle balance, and allow it to assume the stresses necessary to meet
its new function8.
• An underlying goal of surgical management of patients’ requiring LE amputation is to
retain the knee joint given its contribution to more efficient ambulation with a prosthesis,
requiring less energy expenditure9.
III. Acute Post-Surgical – This phase begins immediately post-operatively and continues until the
patient is discharged from the acute care hospital. Goals at this stage are pain control,
optimization of range of motion (ROM) and strength of both lower and upper extremity
musculature, promotion of wound healing, phantom limb pain/sensation management, functional
mobility training, equipment prescription, and continued patient education and emotional
support7. See Treatment section below for specific guidelines.
IV. Pre-prosthetic – Involves residual limb shaping, stump shrinking, skin care, increasing ROM and
muscle strength, cardiovascular training, progressive functional mobility training without a
prosthesis, restoring locus of control of the patient, and patient education and preparation for
prosthetic use4. During initial recovery it is important to restore the individuals’ locus of control.
• Generally 6-8 weeks or longer post-operatively with soft dressings, or 3-6 weeks with use
of an Immediate Post-Operative Prosthesis (IPOP)4.
• Preparatory or training prosthesis may be used to promote residual limb maturation and
for use during gait training.
• Individuals are vulnerable to losses in strength and range of motion (contractures) during
this period.
V. Prosthetic Prescription/Fabrication – Involves team consensus on prosthetic prescription to
satisfy the needs, desires and abilities of the patient.
• Criteria for fitting of LE prosthesis: Wound must have healed, edema must have resolved,
the stump should be conically shaped and stump maturation should be achieved10.
o Obesity can be a limiting factor because most prosthetic devices are designed with a
maximum load of 330 lbs11.
• Patients’ with advanced vascular pathology may be less likely to be able to use a
prosthetic device due to poor skin integrity, delayed healing, and impaired aerobic
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 6

an extended period of time.
VI. Prosthetic Training – Prosthetic management and training to increase wearing time and
functional use.
• For patients s/p AKA and BKA using a soft dressing after amputation, a cast for a
temporary socket is often fabricated 6-8 weeks postoperatively4.
• Ambulation activities with a LE prosthesis often begin during weeks 10-11 after
amputation4.
• The more proximal the amputation, the more energy is demanded from the cardiovascular
and pulmonary systems for prosthetic gait12.
VII. Community Integration – Involves resumption of family and community roles, addressing
emotional needs and developing healthy coping strategies, and resumption of previous and
adapted recreational activities.
VIII. Vocational Rehabilitation – Involves assessment and training for work activities, and assessment
of further education needs or job modification
• On the basis of residual functional capacity, patients may be able to return to their
previous line of work. In many cases patients’ may choose a different line of work,
dependent on the physical demands of the job.
• For the successful reintegration of the amputee, return to work should take place
gradually, with time and workload increasing over several weeks and clinical staff
being available for counseling and consultation7.
IX. Follow-Up – Includes lifelong prosthetic, functional, and medical assessment and psychological
support.
• Patients should be seen for follow-up by one of the team members at least every 3
months for the first 18 months, with physical follow-up every 6 months7.
Rehabilitation Management:
Post-operatively, physical therapy (PT) plays an integral role in restoring function, preparing
patients for a lower-extremity orthotic or prosthetic device, and training them with that device once
it has been fabricated. At BWH, physical therapy is consulted post-operatively by the surgical
team, and the acute post-surgical stage of amputee rehabilitation is initiated. The focus of physical
therapy management begins with initial evaluation on POD#1 if the patient is medically/surgically
appropriate, and includes patient education, mobility, functional training, as well as promoting
wound healing, and optimizing ROM and motor control of the residual and non-affected limbs.
Early mobility has been shown to improve functional outcomes, foster independence, decrease
mortality rates, and reduce acute care length of stay for the person s/p LE amputation13. Among
elderly amputees, an early coordinated post-amputation rehabilitation program may reduce the
time to prosthetic ambulation and the risk of further disability12. If immobility and associated
deconditioning and contracture formation in the residual limb are allowed to occur, prosthetic
fitting and functional outcomes are compromised3. Knowledge of the basic concepts in LE
amputee rehabilitation and the acute care hospital course will help to guide clinical decision
making in the outpatient physical therapy setting.

Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.Contraindications, Precautions, and Considerations for Treatment:
Below are common issues specific to patients undergoing any LE amputation that may impact
physical therapy intervention and overall prognosis.
Early Post-operative Complications:
Recognition of signs and symptoms of early post-operative complications is important and will
require consultation with appropriate health care providers. Potential complications that occur
during the acute care hospital stay that would increase morbidity/mortality and impact the patient’s
ability to participate in therapy, and influence overall prognosis and treatment design and goals
are:
• Blood loss requiring transfusion
• Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
• Pulmonary embolism (PE)
• Cardiac complications including arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and
myocardial infarction (MI)9.
• Systemic complications including pneumonia, renal failure, stroke, and sepsis9.
• Complications at the surgical site include hemorrhage or hematoma, wound infection, and
failure to heal requiring additional operative interventions such as split-thickness skin
grafting (STSG), hematoma evacuation, soft tissue debridement, stump revision, and
conversion to AKA after BKA9.
If a patient presents during the first few days post-operatively with increased pain, excessive
swelling, decreased muscle strength or sensation along a motor and/or sensory nerve distribution,
sudden shortness of breath and decreased oxygen saturation along with increased resting heart rate,
physical therapy interventions must be stopped, and the medical team consulted.
Also see “General Surgery” Standard of Care for general post-operative precautions and
contraindications that may affect appropriateness of PT intervention.
Contractures:
Joint contractures are serious complications that may interfere with prosthetic fitting and proper
gait, and will eventually increase the energy requirements of ambulation14. The joints immediately
proximal to the amputation site may develop contractures if full range of motion is not initiated in
the early post-operative period. Joint contractures can be avoided with proper positioning and
exercise. See “Positioning Guidelines for Edema Management and Prevention of Contractures” in
the intervention section below.
Phantom Limb Pain and Sensation:
Phantom limb sensation is the sensation that the limb is still present, and phantom pain includes
the various painful sensations in the body part that is no longer present15.
• Immediate post-operative incidence of phantom pain and phantom sensation has been
reported to be 72% and 84%, respectively, while the incidence at 6 months post-operatively
changes to 67% and 90%, respectively15.
• Both phantom pain and sensation are generally localized to the distal part of the missing
limb15.
• Persons with phantom limb pain have worse or lower health-related Quality of Life (QOL)
than persons without phantom pain16.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 8
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.• Pre-amputation pain has been shown to significantly increase the incidence of phantom
pain post-amputation17.
• Phantom limb pain and prosthetic use may be inversely related, as it has been shown that
persons using their prosthetic limbs 9 or more hours per day have less phantom pain than
others15.
• Treatments for phantom-limb related symptoms include:
o Pharmacological interventions such as opiods, anticonvulsants, antidepressants,
botulinum toxin, and topical agents such as lidocaine18.
o Surgical treatments such as stump revision, intrathecal implants, trigger point
injections, dorsal root entry zone lesions, and dorsal column tractotomy have been
described. Due to risk of complications and limited benefit, these are generally used in
a limited number of patients15.
o Physical Therapy modalities and techniques as described in the Treatments section
below.
o Alternative techniques such as acupuncture and hypnosis may also be beneficial. 18.
Pain Complications:
Other causes of pain in individuals undergoing LE amputation may include neuromas, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy and bursitis or tendonitis at the end of the residual limb14.
• Neuroma formation is a natural repair phenomenon that may occur when a peripheral nerve
is transected. During the repair phase, axons turn back on themselves and combine with
fibrous tissue to form an enlargement at the distal nerve end. Pain occurs when the
neuroma is situated at the end of the residual limb or at a pressure point in the prosthesis.
Nonoperative interventions include injections with local analgesics or corticosteroids. If
these interventions are ineffective, surgical excision of the neuroma is the treatment of
choice14.
• Reflex sympathetic dystrophy, also called complex regional pain syndrome, includes
sensory, autonomic and motor symptoms that may occur in the affected extremity. The
hallmark of this condition is severe, unremitting pain that is out of proportion to the injury.
Pain is thought to be caused by an abnormal prolongation of the sympathetic reaction to the
injury which produces vasospasm, hyperhidrosis and erythema. Early treatment may
include interruption of the abnormal sympathetic reflex with the use of TENS or
sympathetic blocks, pharmacologic agents, and physical therapy14.
• Bursitis or tendonitis may cause aggravating residual limb pain, characterized by localized
tenderness, mild edema, slight occasional erythema of the overlying skin, increased skin
temperature, and subcutaneous crepitus. If tendonitis is present, passive stretching of the
involved tendon will cause significant pain. Intervention may include cessation of
provocative activities, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, temporary
discontinuation of the prosthesis, rigid immobilization for brief periods, compression
dressings, thermal modalities, corticosteroid injections, analgesic medications, and/or
modification of the prosthetic socket14.
Functional Outcomes:
While up to 85% of vascular amputees are fitted with a prosthesis after major LE amputation, only
5% of these persons use their prosthesis for more than half of their waking hours17. Within 5 years
the use of the prosthesis drops from 85% to 31%. Two years after major LE amputation only 26%
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 9
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.are walking outdoors17. The proportion of total wheelchair users rises from 13% in the first year
after surgery to 39% after 5 years17. For persons undergoing Syme amputation (ankle
disarticulation), the cumulative ambulatory rate at 1, 2, and 5 years has been reported to be 92%,
80% and 80%, respectively17.
Post-operative Mortality:
The life expectation of vascular amputees is short. Survival rates for individuals with dysvascular
pathology undergoing major LE amputations including AKA and BKA have been reported as
69.7% and 34.7% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Mortality was found to be significantly higher for
patients who underwent AKA (50.6% and 22.5% at 1 and 5 years) as compared to BKA (74.5%
and 37.8% at 1 and 5 years)9.
Inpatient Acute Rehab for Patients with Pre-existing LE Amputations:
Patients’ with pre-existing LE amputations may be admitted to the inpatient acute care setting for a
variety of medical reasons related to their amputation or due to unrelated medical issues, including
cardiopulmonary and vascular disease. Physical therapy evaluation and intervention for these
individuals may begin as soon as the patient is medically stable. Considerations, examination
principles and interventions described in this standard of care are applicable in the physical therapy
management of these patients. During the patient interview special attention should be focused on
assessing the patients’ prior level of function, use of assistive devices and prosthetic use. Prosthetic
devices should be brought in from home for these patients to assist with mobility retraining.
Edema of the residual limb and/or muscular atrophy related to medical issues or immobility is
possible, which will affect the patients’ ability to don a prosthesis. Therefore, intervention
techniques for edema management described below, including limb wrapping, may be beneficial
and should be implemented.

O. Outcome Measurement Tools: Outcome measurement tools are a useful way to objectively
measure various aspects of physical and psychological functioning, and to track changes
over time. The therapist should pick an outcome tool that is appropriate for the specific
stage of amputees’ rehabilitation course.
• A lower-extremity amputee specific outcome measure appropriate for use in the
inpatient acute care setting is the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP)19 (Appendix V and
VI). The AMP was developed to enable physicians, prosthetists, and physical therapists
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 12
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.to objectively assess an amputee patient’s functional capabilities with or without a
prosthesis and to predict his/her ability to ambulate with a prosthesis. It is designed to
be administered before prosthetic fitting to predict functional mobility after prosthetic
fitting, to be clinically feasible in terms of time, resources, and ease of use, and to assist
in classifying a patient in Medicare’s 5-level functional classification system (MFCL)
for prosthetic prescription of Medicare-eligible patients (Appendix IV). The AMP is
designed to assess unilateral amputee subjects with and without a prosthesis. However,
bilateral amputee subjects with amputation levels higher than transtarsal foot
amputations must be tested wearing their prosthetic devices.
• The item selection of the AMP is organized with an increasing level of difficulty to
permit progressive assessment of the amputee subject (see Appendix V and VI). Items 1
and 2 test the person’s ability to maintain sitting balance, and if the subject does not
score well the possibility for even limited prosthetic use is remote and the amputee
subject is classified as a MFCL level K0. Items 3 through 7 are specifically designed to
examine the amputee subject’s ability to maintain balance while transferring from chair
to chair and standing unchallenged. The ability to perform these test items safely would
suggest that the patient could manage a prosthesis in limited situations in a supervised
environment. Items 8 through 13 are more challenging activities related to standing
balance. These qualities imply that the amputee subject has the potential to be a safe
household ambulatory and could function at MFCL level K2. Variable cadence,
stepping over a curb or obstacle, and negotiating stairs (AMP items 14 through 20) are
specific activities defined for a Medicare level K3 ambulator19.
• The total score range for the AMP is 0 to 42 points. When used with subjects without a
prosthesis, the highest possible score is 38 points because item 8 (single-limb standing)
is eliminated, as standing on the prosthetic side is impossible. By using an assistive
device, the subjects’ potential total score possibilities increase by 5 points (to 43 and 47
points), depending on the type of assistive device used during testing19.
• Medicare Functional Classification System (MFCL):
o In 1995 Medicare adopted a 5-level functional classification system (MFCL)
which uses code modifiers (K0, K1, K2, K3, K4) to describe the functional
abilities of persons who have undergone lower-limb amputation, and to justify
the medical necessity of certain prosthetic components and
additions19(Appendix IV). By using this system, the physician, prosthetist and
physical therapist are able to determine the patient’s ability to reach a defined
functional state within a reasonable period of time.
• Other outcome measurement tools reported in the literature and more appropriate for
use in an outpatient setting include:
o Functional Independence Measure20
o Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Scale (OPCS)20
o Amputee Activity Score (AAS)20
o Get up and Go Test18
o 6-minute Walk Test18
o Barthel Index18
o Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey18
o Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) 18
o Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI) 18

Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.o Sickness Impact Profile18
o Questionnaire for Persons with Transfemoral Amputation18
o Trinity Amputation and Prosthetic Experience Scale18
o Amputee Body Image Scale: Developed to specifically address body image with
persons with lower extremity amputation, both with and without prosthesis16
Assessment:
Based on the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, patients following LE Amputation are
classified into the following practice pattern:
4J: Impaired Gait, Locomotion, and Balance and Impaired Motor Function Secondary to
Lower Extremity Amputation.
According to this practice pattern, the expected number of visits in an episode of care is 15 to 45.
Other Practice Patterns may be applicable as well.
Patients in this pattern may demonstrate impairments in body structure including, but not limited
to, circulation (arterial, venous or lymphatic), limb amputation and integumentary integrity.
Potential body function changes may include, but are not limited to, muscle performance
(including strength, power, and endurance), ROM (including muscle length), aerobic capacity and
endurance, pain, posture, sensory integrity, gait, locomotion, balance, and knowledge of exercise
program/ACE wrapping techniques.
These impairments will result in decreased independence with bed mobility, transfers, ambulation,
functional activities, basic/instrumental activities of daily living (B/IADL), and may negatively
impact quality of life.
The aim after a LE amputation is to bring the person to an optimum of physical, mental, emotional,
social, vocational, and economic efficiency, and requires a multidisciplinary approach17. The
primary goals of inpatient physical therapy while in the acute care setting are pain control,
optimizing range of motion (ROM) and strength of both lower and upper extremity musculature,
promotion of wound healing, early mobilization and maximization of functional independence, and
to develop the skills necessary to progress towards prior level of activity and social participation as
appropriate.
Suggested short-term goals (STG) to be achieved in 3-5 days in patients who were independent
prior to acute care hospital admission are:
1. Patients will demonstrate Independence with bed mobility
2. Patients will demonstrate Independence with transfers to wheelchair with least restrictive
assistive device
3. Patients will demonstrate Independence with ambulation >/= 100 feet with least restrictive
assistive device
4. Patients will demonstrate Independence or assisted with stairs as necessary
5. Patients will demonstrate ROM WFL and strength > 3/5 throughout affected and non-
affected limb, as appropriate
6. Patients will demonstrate good balance in sitting and/or standing with device
7. Patients will perform an initial independent exercise program
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 14
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.8. Patient/family will demonstrate good understanding of residual limb management, edema
control, and frequent skin inspection/skin care
9. Patient/family will demonstrate Independence with wrapping techniques (or with family
assist)
10. Patients will demonstrate good safety awareness with all functional mobility
These STG will vary depending on the patient’s prior functional level, as well as the patient’s own
personal goals. If the above goals do not appear they will be met during the inpatient acute care
hospital stay then inpatient rehab should be considered.
Long-Term Goals:
The predicted optimal level of improvement for this patient population is to return to their previous
life roles and lifestyle using a prosthetic and/or assistive devices and adaptive equipment, as
appropriate, in 4-6 months. This prognosis may need to be modified due to any of the following
factors: presence of co-morbidities, post-op complications or secondary impairments, decreased
cognitive status, barriers to returning to previous living environment and any other factors that may
influence the patient’s ability to use a prosthetic device and decrease their independence.
Prognosis:
When setting attainable short and long-term goals, the therapist should be aware of, and document,
factors that may negatively or positively affect that person’s prognosis. Prognosis for person’s s/p
LE amputation may be negatively affected by any of the following factors:
• Presence of co-morbidities, such as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and Coronary
Artery Disease (CAD), which may increase mortality and affect recovery21.
• Pre-operative ambulatory status, as non-ambulatory and homebound status is associated
with inability to use a prosthesis post-operatively21.
• Age > 60 years at time of surgery is associated with decreased post-operative prosthetic
use, increased mortality, and decreased ability to ambulate and maintain an independent
living status21.
• Level of amputation, as persons undergoing bilateral or AKA are less likely to ambulate,
use a prosthesis, and achieve independent living status post-operatively21.
• Presence of post-op complications or secondary impairments, including phantom pain and
sensation, which may negatively influence rehabilitation process.
• Decreased cognitive status, including dementia, may prevent persons from achieving an
independent living status post-operatively21.
• Barriers to returning to previous living environment and any other factors that may
influence the patient’s ability to use a prosthetic device and decrease their independence.
Treatment Planning / Interventions
Established Pathway ___ Yes _X__ No
Established Protocol ___ Yes _X__ No
1. Interventions:
This section is intended to capture the most commonly used interventions for this case
type/diagnosis. It is not intended to be either inclusive or exclusive of appropriate interventions.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 15
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.A. Therapeutic exercise program for acute and subacute LE amputations:
• Exercise programs for the LE amputee should focus on four main components:
flexibility, muscle strength, cardiovascular training, and balance7.
• Flexibility or stretching exercises to help prevent muscle shortening and joint
contractures should be performed in a slow, controlled manner and held for at least 20
seconds. See positioning guidelines below.
• Strengthening exercises may include isometric, isotonic, PNF and isokinetic activities.
o For the unilateral lower-limb amputee, the non-affected limb becomes the sole
support limb. Stance-phase stability requires adequate strength of the hip extensors
and abductors, knee extensors and plantarflexors. Swing-phase limb advancement and
clearance require adequate hip flexor and ankle strength. Frequently, the non-affected
limb can develop symptoms consistent with overuse7.
o Sitting balance, bed mobility and transfers are facilitated by strong, flexible back and
abdominal flexors, rotators, and extensors and hip extensors7.
o Shoulder stabilizers, adductors and depressors, elbow extensors, wrist stabilizers and
grip strength are important for supporting the body during transfers and during the
use of assistive devices7.
o For persons undergoing AKA, strength of operative (residual) limb hip extensors and
abductors should be emphasized for eventual prosthetic use.
o For persons undergoing BKA, strength of the operative (residual) limb hip extensors
and abductors and knee flexors and extensors should be emphasized for eventual
prosthetic use.
o For persons undergoing external hemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation, strength of
the upper extremities, abdominals and contralateral lower limb must be maximized.
Persons with a hip disarticulation must be able to perform a posterior pelvic tilt to
initiate swing phase with a prosthesis, so good abdominal control is necessary4.
• Cardiovascular training may be initiated as appropriate to patient tolerance in order to
improve endurance and functional mobility tolerance. Duration, frequency, intensity and
mode may be changed according to the needs and abilities of the patient.
o Wheelchair mobility or upper-extremity ergometry can be used in the pre-prosthetic
phase. Swimming may be initiated as appropriate once incision has healed, and is an
excellent exercise for patients’ who have sensitive residual limbs or may need to
minimize weight-bearing impact4.
• Balance training should include sitting and standing, static and dynamic activities as
appropriate. Patients can be further challenged by reaching for objects, using
soft/unstable surfaces, and accepting external forces.
• Post-op Day #1: Initiate AA/AROM or theraband exercises for UE’s and non-affected
limb. Initiate isometrics, AAROM, AROM for residual limb. Exercises may include
Quad sets, glut sets, hip IR/ER, hip adduction isometrics, bridging, seated push-ups
(dips), and supine hip/knee flexion. (See Appendix I for suggested initial therapeutic
exercise program).
B. Positioning Guidelines for Edema Management and Prevention of Contractures:
• Positioning Guidelines for Patients with Transtibial and Transfemoral Amputations:
o Contractures may develop due to improper positioning in bed or prolonged sitting in
a wheelchair. Contractures of the hip flexors, abductors, and external rotators are
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 16
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.common in the transfemoral amputee (AKA). The transtibial amputee (BKA) is at
risk for developing hip and knee flexion contractures7.
o For transfemoral amputees (AKA), if a person has a hip flexion contracture greater
than 15 degrees, prosthetic fitting must wait until contracture is no greater than 10
degrees11.
o Encourage periods of lying supine or prone (to tolerance) to provide a prolonged
low-load stretch on the hip flexors and prevent hip flexion contracture.
o Some physicians prefer the post-operative limb to be elevated for edema
management. While this may be beneficial, the patient should be educated about the
need to lie fully supine or prone to prevent contractures.
o For transtibial amputees (BKA), a knee immobilizer is often used for residual limb
positioning and to prevent contracture. Considerations for wearing schedule should
include motor control of residual limb, mental status, and integumentary integrity.
Encourage careful/thorough skin inspection as knee immobilizer may cause pressure
from the posterior stay or if it is strapped improperly over the patella. The knee
immobilizer can be trimmed for best fit and to minimize skin issues. As an
alternative, a posterior orthoplast splint can be made.
o Elastic stockinette or ACE bandage may be wrapped over the post-operative
dressing to prevent edema accumulation in the residual limb.
o Transtibial amputees (BKA) should be instructed on proper limb positioning in chair
with knee at 0 degrees extension.
• Positioning Guidelines for Patients with TMA or toe amputations:
o Elevate surgical limb while sitting in chair and lying in bed.
C. Dressings: Post-operative dressings can contain post-operative drainage, edema and facilitate
prosthetic fitting. Dressings after amputation include4:
• Soft Dressing: Gauze, cotton padding and an elastic bandage. Most common.
• Semi-rigid Dressing: Uses a Unna Paste bandage. Uncommon at BWH.
• Rigid Dressing: Stump is wrapped by a rigid plaster cast socket that fixes the knee in
extension immediately post-op or within days of surgery. Use of a rigid dressing, either
immediate or delayed, has been shown to result in shorter time period from amputation to
delivery of first prosthesis and decrease risk for knee flexion contracture in transtibial
amputees10. Advantages reportedly include improved wound healing, prevention of
edema, prevention of knee flexion contracture, and ability to load the extremity/begin gait
training in approximately one week thus preventing secondary complications due to
immobility. Disadvantages may include increased risk for pressure ulcers and delay in
detecting wound problems10. Uncommon at BWH.
• Removable Rigid Dressing: Functions as rigid dressing above but can be removed daily to
inspect the limb for healing. Uncommon at BWH.
• Immediate Postoperative Prosthesis (IPOP): A hard cast is applied to the residual limb, and
a pylon and foot are attached to allow for immediate gait training. Patients with
transtibial and knee disarticulation may be permitted to weight-bear up to 40 lbs on the
residual limb22. Used until sutures are removed22. Most often used following trauma for
young patients who have good balance and skin integrity4. Uncommon at BWH.
D. Limb Shaping: Indications for use of compression devices include edema management,
shaping the residual limb, prevention of contractures, reducing an “adductor roll” in
transfemoral amputees, and desensitization4. Commonly used compression devices include:
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 17
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.• Elastic Wraps: Use of elastic bandages, usually 3, 4, or 6 inches in width. Elastic bandaging
is initiated by the Physical Therapist, changed daily to ensure good pressure gradient
from distal to proximal. In the preprosthetic phase bandages should be worn 24 hours per
day, except for bathing4. Elastic stockinet is an acceptable substitution to ACE wrap. (See
Appendix II for residual limb wrapping techniques)
• Shrinkers: Once the incision is healed and sutures removed (typically 10-21 days after
surgery), use of a compression device is appropriate4, clarify with MD. Often more
practical due to ease of application, especially for transfemoral amputees4. Outside
vendor is contacted if there is a need while at BWH.
E. Integument: Perform skin inspection as appropriate during treatment sessions, and educate pt
on need for frequent skin inspection.
F. Mobility and Gait Training:
• Time to fitting of prosthesis is usually 6-8 weeks or longer4, once stump has matured. In
the meantime, gait training is initiated without a prosthesis10.
• Functional mobility training for individuals undergoing LE amputation may be initiated
post-op day #1, as appropriate given the patient’s medical status, and progressed based on
patient tolerance and ability levels using the treating physical therapist’s discretion.
• Early post-operative mobilization will reduce the risk of patient’s developing orthostatic
hypotension.
• For patients s/p AKA or BKA, the following activity guidelines have been reported13:
o Post-op Day #1: Bed mobility, therapeutic exercises.
o Post-op Day #2: Sitting edge of bed and transfer training. Out of bed no more than 2
hours BID.
o Post-op Day #3: Ambulate as tolerated with assistive device.
o Post-op Day #4 to discharge: Continue ambulation BID and OOB to chair BID.
Progress distance of ambulation to patient’s tolerance. Encourage exercises when in
bed or sitting in chair.
• For patient’s s/p transmetatarsal, forefoot and toe amputations, the following activity
guidelines have been reported13:
o Post-op Day #1: OOB to chair no more than 2 hours BID. Clarify LE weight bearing
status with medical team, as patients’ may require heel weight bearing post-op shoe for
operative extremity.
o Post-op Day #2: Ambulate as tolerated TID
o Post-op Day #3 until discharge: Continue ambulation TID, progress distance ambulated
to patient’s tolerance. OOB to chair to tolerance.
• Gait training should begin on flat surfaces with emphasis initially on technique and style
and then on velocity, and should then be progressed to uneven surfaces and elevations
including stairs as tolerated7.
• Clarify orders for patients who have medical or wound healing complications. Refer to
intensive care unit (ICU) standards of care if appropriate.
• For patients with limited mobility, a slide board may be used to transfer from bed to
wheelchair or to a car.
• Wheelchair mobility training should be initiated, if appropriate, in order to improve
endurance and develop skills needed to negotiate a wheelchair both indoors and outdoors.
G. Skin-desensitization program: Desensitization activities decrease hypersensitivity of the
residual limb, are important for pain management and may be necessary before the patient is
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 18
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.able to tolerate the pressure of an orthosis/prosthesis4. Activities include gentle
rubbing/tapping, massage, soft-tissue and scar mobilization7. Performed initially by the
therapist, and then taught to the patient/family to be performed independently.
H. Pain Management strategies:
• Biofeedback
• Relaxation and Breathing Techniques
• Cryotherapy
I. Phantom Limb Pain and Sensation: Physical Therapy modalities and techniques used in the
treatment of phantom limb pain and sensation include:
• Electrical stimulations such as auricular electrical stimulation, Transcutaneous Electrical
Nerve Stimulation or TENS, spinal cord stimulation, and motor cortex stimulation have
been used with variable results15.
o TENS has been demonstrated to have about a 50% success rate in the treatment of
phantom pain15.
• Mechanical stimulations such as stump massage, percussions, and vibratory
stimulations15.
• Ultrasound, superficial heat and cryotherapy have been reported to have some success in
short-term pain relief15.
• Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, in which a series of rapid and rhythmic
eye movements are induced by the therapist15.
• Mirror Box Therapy: A treatment for phantom limb pain in which amputees use a
mirror/mirror box to view a reflection of their anatomical limb in the visual space
occupied by the phantom limb. Pain relief is hypothesized to be due to cortical
restructuring achieved by activation of the mirror neurons in the hemisphere of the brain
contralateral to the amputated side, and may help the person recreate a coherent body
image and update internal models of motor control15,23,24.
o Treatment may include performance of a therapeutic exercise program with bilateral
lower limbs, the amputated limb visualized as the contralateral limb in the mirror, in
order to gain a greater sense of “control” of the phantom limb and reduce pain25.
o Continued practice is generally required for sustained results24.
• Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in which movements of the persons opposite anatomical
limb are transposed into the movements of a virtual limb using a virtual reality head-
mounted display has been shown to offer some short-term benefit23.
J. Coordination, Communication and Documentation: Communication and collaboration among
the interdisciplinary team, the patient, and family members is essential for successful
rehabilitation of the person undergoing a LE amputation. Interdisciplinary teamwork is
facilitated by appropriate documentation in the medical record. Discuss the patient’s need for
additional services with the primary team. The patient may benefit from the following
services/referrals:
• Occupational Therapy: Recommend an Occupational Therapy consult for patients who
present with impairments that affect their ability to perform activities of daily living
independently and who may have adaptive equipment needs. This applies for most
patients’ after a lower extremity amputation being discharged directly home.
• Speech and Swallowing: If a patient presents with impairments that affect his or her
ability to swallow without difficulty and/or presents with a new communication
impairment.

assessment, especially for diabetics.
• Psychiatry: May be considered for the psychological and social adjustments and coping
required after the loss of a body part.
• Care Coordination: If a patient has a complicated discharge situation and the care
coordinator is not already involved.
• Social Work: If a patient has a complicated social history and/or he or she requires
additional support or counseling.
• Chaplaincy: If a patient requires spiritual support or counseling.
2. Patient/Family Education:
• Discuss realistic expectations regarding function, appropriate level of assist that patient
requires from family, rehab progression, changes in body image, and potential for
phantom sensation/pain.
• Discuss safety awareness and fall prevention strategies including asking for appropriate
assistance during mobility and use of assistive devices, as it has been reported that one
in five persons with lower limb amputation will experience a fall during inpatient
rehabilitation, with 18% sustaining an injury26. Risk factors for falls in persons after
major LE amputation include age greater than 71 years, extended inpatient rehabilitation
hospital stay (>3 weeks), four or more significant comorbidities, cognitive impairment,
and use of benzodiazepines or opiates26.
• Instruct the patient and family members in the following techniques and assess their
understanding via return demonstration:
o Proper residual limb positioning and use of knee immobilizer, prone positioning
as appropriate
o Therapeutic exercise program
o Safe mobility techniques encouraging maximal independence
o ACE wrapping or shrinker sock use, as appropriate
3. Emotional Support:
• Limb loss is a life-altering event that requires the patient to grieve. Amputees are often
concerned acutely about helplessness and dependency, especially in elderly populations.
Efforts should be made to restore the patient’s locus of control.
• Provide emotional support to the patient and family.
4. Available handouts (post in room and/or distribute to patient upon discharge):
• Amputee exercise program (see Appendix I)
• Residual limb wrapping (see Appendix II)
• Amputee support groups and resources (see Appendix III)
5. Frequency of Treatment:
Initially these patients are seen 5-7 times weekly to implement positioning, exercise, mobility
programs, depending on medical status and appropriateness to participate with therapy program.
Treatment can be decreased to 3 times weekly when patient is independent with exercises and
positioning. Treatment continues at 5-7 times weekly if the discharge plan is to home or patient's
function is severely decreased.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 20
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.Re-evaluation / assessment:
Patients are re-evaluated on a daily basis with respect to their range of motion, muscle
performance, skin integrity, quality of movement, pain intensity, and functional mobility
status/level of independence. If the patient’s hospital course is prolonged past the timeline set in
the short term goals, or if a significant change in medical status occurs, a formal re-evaluation will
be performed to re-assess progression towards the previously outlined goals and outcomes every 7-
10 days. In the outpatient setting, the patient is to be formally re-evaluated every 30 days.
Discharge Planning:
Overall acute care length of stay is decreasing in the U.S.3,27. Acute care length of stay and
discharge destination for persons undergoing LE amputation are dependent on multiple factors
including the individual’s payer source, amputation level, comorbidities, age, social supports, and
injury characteristics3,27. While the majority of persons with trauma-related amputations are able to
discharge from acute care directly to home, more proximal amputation levels, bilateral LE
amputations, presence of severe injuries to other body systems, and acute care at a designated
trauma center increase the likelihood of discharge to inpatient rehabilitation among trauma-related
amputees3. For persons with dysvascular amputations, there has been an increase in discharge to
nursing home and inpatient rehabilitation centers in recent years, which is likely related to a
reduction in acute care length of stay27. Likelihood of discharge to a nursing facility has been
found to increase with age, higher amputation levels, and those with Medicare insurance among
dysvascular amputees, while men and married patients are less likely to be discharged to a skilled
nursing facility (SNF)27.
Post-operatively, many patients are discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (acute or sub-acute) or
skilled nursing facilities, and will continue to progress toward their physical therapy goals, initiate
prosthetic fitting and home planning as appropriate. A person may be able to discharge directly to
home with services if they meet short term goals physical therapy goals. If the patient is discharged
home, an environment which is wheelchair and disability friendly will allow for better functional
outcomes1. Consider the following resources for continued therapy:
• VNA PT
• Prosthetic evaluation when appropriate
• Outpatient PT for patients with high level of function and for prosthetic gait training as
appropriate.
Prosthetic Prescription and Use:
Timing of prosthetic fitting and training varies widely, dependent on multiple factors including age
of patient and type of amputation (traumatic vs. dysvascular). Prosthetic training may begin while
the patient is in an inpatient rehab setting or during outpatient follow-up. Fitting of the first
prosthesis should be implemented as soon as possible after wound healing. Choice of prosthetic
device should be individualized based on the functional capacity and goals of the person, with the
intent to allow the highest possible level of function. A team approach to prosthetic prescription
writing should be used whenever possible, and should include a physiatrist, physical therapist and
prosthetist working closely together to optimize outcomes for the amputee28.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 21

Oxygen consumption increases approximately 33% for the transtibial amputee, and nearly doubles
for the transfemoral amputee28. Due to the increasing cardiopulmonary demands with more
proximal or bilateral amputations, the level of amputation has a direct effect on successful
prosthetic rehabilitation in the older patient29.
Prosthetic limb choices have increased dramatically over the past several years8, but the basic
components remain the same for all LE prosthetic devices: a foot, pylon, socket, suspension
system and, if appropriate, a knee mechanism.
• Prosthetic Feet: The foot (or terminal device) serves as a shock absorber and provides a
stable weight-bearing surface28. A variety of prosthetic feet are currently available, ranging
from the simple SACH foot to the sophisticated energy storing and multiaxis function of
some feet8.
• Suspension System: The prosthetic socket may be suspended in a number of ways
including various cuffs and sleeves, which hold to socket onto the residual limb. Suction is
often a feature, which contributes to reliable suspension of the socket. Another type of
popular suspension system involves a pin on the bottom of a liner, which inserts and locks
into a pinhole at the bottom of the socket28.
• Sockets and Liners: Sockets are custom made by obtaining a negative impression of the
residual limb in plaster and made of plastic materials such as polyester resin8. Sockets for
individuals with a transtibial amputation may be patellar tendon bearing (PTB), which
offers areas of weight-bearing pressure and relief, or total surface bearing (TSB), which
distributes pressure more equally throughout the residual limb4. Sockets for individuals
with a transfemoral amputation generally include the quadrilateral socket, named for its’
square appearance in the transverse plane, and ischial-containment socket, which has a
wider anteroposterior (AP) dimension and narrower mediolateral (ML) dimension4. Liners
allow for total contact between the residual limb and prosthetic socket, and may be added
or taken off dependent on daily edema changes in the residual limb.
• Prosthetic Knees: Can have a single axis or be poly-centric8. Most basic prosthetic knee has
a locking mechanism that is manually applied to provide stability in the stance phase, with
more advanced options including a weight activated brake or a fluid controlled cylinder8.
To control limb displacement during swing phase options are available and include friction,
springs, and fluid resistance8. Electric controllers for the timing and amount of fluid
resistance (the C-Leg) results in a less effortful and safer gait pattern8.
For persons undergoing hip disarticulation or external hemipelvectomy, the skeletal structure and
soft tissue available for prosthetic weight bearing are significantly compromised and result in an
increased incidence of skin breakdown30. Lower extremity prosthetics for these patients’ will
include a hip socket and prosthetic hip joint. Prosthetic sockets for external hemipelvectomy
encase the abdominal cavity and provide hard walls that protect and compress the abdominal
viscera so that these areas may accept weight-bearing, and may extend superiorly to the tenth rib to
allow additional vertical loading4. The hip disarticulation socket encloses the ischial tuberosity and
gluteal muscles for weight bearing, extends over the ilium to provide suspension, and also encases
the opposite pelvis to assist in mediolateral trunk stability4. The prosthetic hip joint in the hip
disarticulation prosthesis is attached to the socket anteriorly, which causes the weight line to fall
posterior to the hip and anterior to the knee, to assist hip and knee extension, and also to allow the

proximal levels of amputation4.
Once appropriate, the patient with a LE amputation should ideally be able to use a prosthesis
during most of the day. Upon initiation of ambulation activities with a prosthesis, skin problems
may develop, and should be anticipated in patients with PVD and/or DM. Any abrasion,
maceration or blister mandates immediate discontinuation of prosthesis use, and the physician and
prosthetist should be notified11. Initially, the patient should wear the prosthesis for up to 15
minutes, followed by skin inspection and a 15 minute rest period with a shrinker or elastic wrap in
place to avoid residual-limb edema4. This schedule of 15 minutes wear/15 minutes rest should be
followed during the first few days of prosthesis training, and advanced as tolerated4.

Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights Reserved.Appendix VI: Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP) Testing Protocol19
The AMP testing protocol can be administered by a clinician, without an assistant. The
average time required to administer the AMP or AMPnoPRO is less than 15 minutes and
often less than 10 minutes for an experienced examiner. The necessary equipment for
testing consists of the following: a stopwatch, 2 chairs, a 12-in ruler, a pencil, a 4-in high
obstacle (preferably 18-24in long), and a set of stairs with 3 steps. A safety or gait belt is
also suggested, along with the assistive device of the amputee’s choosing. The
AMPnoPRO eliminates question 8 because the task of standing on the prosthetic side is
not possible. The use of an assistive device during testing is accounted for in the scoring
system. The prosthesis wearer may use whatever assistive device he/she is most
comfortable with whenever he/she requests it.
The following is an item-by-item description of the AMP testing and scoring procedure.
Item 1: Sitting balance
Task: The amputee subject sits upright in a chair; the patient’s buttocks are
slightly forward so that there is no support from the back of the chair and his/her arms are
folded comfortably in the lap.
Score 0: The amputee subject cannot sit independently for 60 seconds or requires
the observer’s support or guarding.
Score 1: The amputee subject sits independently for 60 seconds and does not
require support or guarding from the observer.
Item 2: Sitting reach
Task: Seated as in item 1, the amputee reaches forward and grasps a ruler held
by the observer midline to the patient’s sternum and 12 in beyond the patient’s dominant
hand or sound limb side (the patient’s choice).
Score 0: Does not attempt the task or verbally refuses it because of fear or lack
of confidence that he/she may complete the task
Score 1: Cannot grasp the ruler or requires arm support of either the chair or
assistive device.
Score 2: Reaches forward and successfully grasps the ruler.
Item 3: Chair to chair transfer
Task: The amputee subject sits upright in an armless chair and is asked to
transfer from 1 chair to another set at a 90° angle to the first. The amputee subject may
choose direction to his/her amputated side or nonamputated side. Use of hands is
permitted.
Score 0: Cannot transfer independently or requires physical assistance to
complete the task.
Score 1: Performs independently, but appears unsteady or requires contact
guarding.
Score 2: Performs independently, appears to be steady and safe.
Item 4: Arises from a chair
Task: The amputee subject sits upright and forward in a chair, arms folded
comfortably across the chest. The observer asks the amputee subject to stand without

Reserved.using the arms for assistance unless it is necessary and then he/she may use the chair or
assistive device.
Score 0: Unable to rise without physical assistance, this includes contact
guarding.
Score 1: Able to rise but must use his/her arms, the chair, or an assistive device.
Score 2: Able to rise without using arms; in other words, they stand hands free.
Item 5: Attempts to arise from a chair
Task: If the amputee subject attempted in item 4 to rise without using his/her
arms but failed in that attempt to arise from the chair, then ignore item 4 and allow
another attempt (item 5) without penalty. However, if the amputee subject has difficulty
and requires additional attempts or physical assistance or guarding, he/she must be
graded accordingly in item 5, with the following scores:
Score 0: Unable to arise without the help of physical assistance or contact
guarding.
Score 1: Able to stand independently but requires more than 1 attempt to reach
the standing position.
Score 2: Able to rise to standing in a single attempt.
Item 6: Immediate standing balance
Task: Have stopwatch ready and begin timing the first 5 seconds that transpire
immediately after the amputee achieves upright standing posture in front of the chair,
with or without support of an assistive device. Be sure to check that the amputee is not
leaning against the chair with his/her legs.
Score 0: Unsteady posture causes amputee to stagger, move foot quickly in an
attempt to maintain balance, or sway excessively. A steady posture with normal foot
movement to adjust for comfortable standing is permitted without penalty.
Score 1: Able to attain a steady standing posture using a walking aid or other
support such as a chair back that has been provided to assist with the testing task.
Score 2: Able to attain a steady standing posture without walker or other support.
Item 7: Standing balance
Task: standing balance is timed for 30 seconds by stopwatch. The first attempt
is made without an assistive device. If during the task, the observer believes that an
assistive device will help the amputee to stand safely, then repeat items 6 and 7 with an
assistive device.
Score 0: The amputee subject is unsteady or unable to hold for 30 seconds a
satisfactory upright posture that does not require contact guarding or support.
Score 1: Stands steady for 30 seconds but uses a walking aid or other support.
Score 2: Stands for 30 seconds without assistive device or physical support.
Item 8: Single-limb standing balance
Task: By using the stopwatch, the observer asks the amputee subject to stand
first on the sound limb and then on the prosthesis for 30 seconds each. The observer
grades the amputee’s performance on both sides unless the amputee subject is being
tested without a prosthesis, in which case scoring of the prosthetic side is ignored.
Score 0: If the amputee subject cannot show single-limb standing for 30 seconds
even with an assistive device, the stance is considered unsteady.
Score 1: If the amputee subject grasps, even for a moment, a walking aid or
requires other support, he/she is considered steady but requiring support.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 39
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights
Reserved.Score 2: The amputee subject can maintain single-limb standing without support
for 30 seconds.
Item 9: Standing reach
Task: The amputee subject stands with his/her feet 2 to 4in apart and reaches
forward to grasp a ruler that is held by the observer midline to the amputee subject’s
sternum and 12in beyond his/her dominant hand or sound limb side (the amputee
subject’s choice). The amputee subject may not take a step forward, but may place the
prosthetic limb in a position of comfort if the socket brim interferes with performance.
Score 0: Does not attempt the task or verbally refuses it because of fear or lack
of confidence that he/she may complete the task.
Score 1: Cannot grasp the ruler or requires arm support from an assistive device.
Score 2: Reaches forward and successfully grasps the ruler.
Item 10: Nudge test
Task: The amputee subject stands as comfortably possible with feet together; the
examiner pushes firmly on subject’s sternum with palm of hand 3 times, quickly, with a
consistent pressure that would cause a body weight to move toward the heels but not
typically cause a person to lose balance in a normal situation.
Score 0: The amputee subject begins to fall and requires the observer’s
assistance.
Score 1: The amputee subject cannot or will not stand without the use of the
assistive device or he/she stands independently and when nudged staggers, grabs at
support, or catches self.
Score 2: The amputee subject remains steady with independent standing free of
assistive device.
Item 11: Eyes closed
Task: The amputee subject stands with his/her feet 2 to 4in apart. Stopwatch
ready, the observer asks the amputee to close his/her eyes and maintain standing posture
for 30 seconds.
Score 0: The amputee subject is unable to stand in a steady position for 30
seconds without using an assistive device.
Score 1: The amputee subject remains steady accomplishing independent
standing without the use of an assistive device.
Item 12: Picking up objects off the floor
Task: The amputee subject stands with his/her feet 2 to 4in apart. The observer
places a pencil (or similar object of same height) on the floor midline from the amputee
subject and 12in from the toe of the amputee subject’s shoe. The observer asks the
amputee to pick up the object off the floor without moving his/her feet, knee straight, and
(if safely possible) without using any support.
Score 0: The amputee subject cannot pick up the object and return to standing
safely.
Score 1: The amputee subject performs the task with some support from an
assistive device, chair, or person.
Score 2: The amputee subject performs the task without any help from object or
person.
Item 13: Sitting down
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 40
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights
Reserved.Task: The examiner asks the subject to fold his/her arms across the chest and sit
down in a controlled manner. If the amputee is unable to perform the task, or is unsure,
the examiner suggests the amputee subject use his/her arms or an assistive device.
Score 0: The amputee subject misjudges distance to the chair, falls into the chair,
or requires contact guarding and is scored as unsafe.
Score 1: The amputee subject chooses for security or necessity to use his/her
arms or cannot sit in a smooth and controlled motion.
Score 2: The amputee subject sits in a safe, smooth, and controlled motion.
To ensure safe ambulation in items 14-20, walking aids are permitted and
encouraged whether or not the amputee wears a prosthesis. Item 21 compensates for the
decision to use an assistive device on the ambulation tasks.
Item 14: Initiation of gait
Task: From a standing posture with or without an assistive device, as the
amputee prefers and the clinician determines to be safe, the amputee is asked to begin
walking.
Score 0: The amputee subject shows hesitancy, makes multiple attempts to start,
or appears to be consciously organizing in their minds the process of initiating walking
beyond the cognition required for normal ambulation.
Score 1: The amputee starts walking with no hesitancy, with a smooth transition
from standing to walking.
Item 15: Step length and height
Task: The amputee subject walks a measured distance of 12ft (3.66m) twice (up
and back) for a total of 24ft (7.32m). Four scores are required, ie, 2 scores (a,b) for the
left leg and 2 for the right. “Marked deviation” is defined as extreme substitute
movements made to permit the foot to clear the floor.
a. Swing foot
Score 0: The leg does not advance a minimum of 12in. If ambulating without
the prosthesis and with an assistive device, the same applies: the swing limb must
advance a minimum of 12in.
Score 1: The swing advances a minimum of 12in, whether the prosthetic limb or
the sound limb is being tested.
b. Floor clearance
Score 0: The foot does not completely clear floor with step or deviation. This
description includes foot shuffling, sliding, and marked deviations such as circumduction
that require significant substitution for clearing the floor.
Score 1: The foot completely clears floor without marked deviation
Item 16: Step continuity
Task: As the amputee subject performs the task described in item 15, the
examiner observes the quality of gait. Step continuity is defined as continuous steps that
are that are devoid of hesitation (i.e., marked differences in step length that require
adjustment for loss of balance between steps), and without difficulty maneuvering the
assistive device sufficient to interrupt step continuity.
Score 0: The amputee exhibits stopping or discontinuity between steps that
interrupts a smooth continuous gait.
Score 1: The amputee subject’s steps appear to be continuous.
Item 17: Turning
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 41
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights
Reserved.Task: As the amputee subject completes the first 12ft of ambulation and turns to
return to the chair, the examiner notes the quality of the movement.
Score 0: The amputee subject is unable to turn and therefore requires
intervention such as contact guarding and verbal instructions in order not to fall.
Score 1: The amputee subject requires more than 3 steps to complete the task but
requires no contact or verbal intervention.
Score 2: The amputee subject completes the task in 3 or fewer continuous steps,
with or without an assistive aid.
Item 18: Variable cadence
Task: The examiner instructs the patient to walk a distance of 12ft fast as safely
possible 4 times for a total of 48ft (14.63m). Speeds may vary from slow to fast and fast
to slow, varying cadence. This task may also be completed with an assistive device
although care must be taken that the patient is not extended beyond his/her capabilities.
Score 0: The patient is unable to vary cadence in a controlled manner.
Score 1: The patient asymmetrically increases his/her cadence in a controlled
manner so that step length markedly differs between legs, and/or balance must be re-
established with each step.
Score 2: The patient symmetrically increases his/her cadence in a controlled
manner so that step lengths are equal and balance is maintained.
Item 19: Stepping over obstacle
Task: Place a movable, 4in high box or hurdle (length, 18-24in) in the walking
path. The object must be of a design that will not cause the amputee to stumble or fall
should he/she be unable to complete the task. The amputee is asked to step over the
obstacle without interrupting step continuity. This task may be performed en route to or
from the stair climbing task. The amputee subject is penalized if he/she attempts to
circumduct the obstacle by swinging the prosthetic limb to side of the obstacle.
Score 0: The amputee subject cannot step over the box.
Score 1: The amputee subject catches his/her foot on the obstacle, circumducts it,
or interrupts stride by stopping in front of the obstacle to prepare physically or mentally
to clear it.
Score 2: The amputee steps over the obstacle without interrupting stride.
Item 20: Stairs
Task: The examiner instructs the amputee to try to go up and down stairs without
holding on to the railing. However, to ensure safety, do not hesitate to permit the
amputee to grasp the rail. The stairs must have a minimum of 2 steps; 3 to 4 steps are
preferred.
a. Ascending
Score 0: Unsteady, cannot ascend stairs or expresses fear of or inability to
attempt the task.
Score 1: Ascends stairs 1 step at a time, or must hold on to railing or assistive
device.
Score 2: Ascends stairs step-over-step and does not hold onto the railing or
assistive device.
b. Descending
Score 0: Unsteady, cannot descend stairs or expresses fear of or inability to
attempt the task.
Standard of Care: Lower Extremity Amputation 42
Copyright ©2011 The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All Rights
Reserved.Score 1: Descends stairs 1 step at a time, or must hold on to railing or assistive
device.
Score 2: Descends stairs step-over-step and does not hold onto the railing or
assistive device.
Item 21: Assistive device selection
Task: Points are awarded based on the use of an assistive device for items 14 to
20. If the amputee subject required an assistive device because the stairs lacked a railing,
but he/she did not use an assistive device for ambulation, then award points based on the
performance on items 14 to 19.
Score 0: Bed bound
Score 1: Wheelchair
Score 2: Walker
Score 3: Crutches (axillary or forearm)
Score 4: Cane (straight or quad)

Hand Washing When You Have a Prosthetic Hand,"Hand Washing When You Have a
Prosthetic Hand
by Amber Henson
3 min read
Feb 10, 2020
Keeping your new terminal device clean doesn’t have to be complicated. But
you do have to make sure to follow the correct procedure for your type of
prosthesis. Please read on for information about different terminal devices and
how they can be cleaned. We also have information and tips for how to get
your sound hand clean when you can’t use your terminal device to help wash
it. You can find more prosthesis ""Do's and Don'ts"" in our Upper Limb Library
as well. You may also find our article regarding which devices are waterproof
and water-resistant helpful.
PassivePassive prosthetic devices are generally made out of plastic, silicone or metal
(such as the Point Designs Digits). These types of devices are usually water-
resistant, meaning they can be washed the same as a sound hand — just
don’t soak them in water, and if the device gets saltwater on it, be sure to
rinse with fresh water. It is not recommended to use antibacterial soap on
silicone devices. For a more thorough sanitization of the passive prosthesis,
use alcohol spray and wipe with a clean cloth, or follow the instructions as
given by your prosthetist, therapist or in the manual that came with your
device.
Body-powered
Similar to passive devices, these are generally tolerant of water. Body-
powered hooks and smaller devices, like those from Naked Prosthetics, can
be washed the same as a sound hand. Be sure to sanitize as needed per the
instructions given with the device.
Electric/Myoelectric
Here is where things get tricky. Obviously one of the reasons people get
electric hands is to help them throughout their day. But how are they
supposed to get through their day with a hand they can’t wash?
There are some you can wash — the ETD (electric terminal device, AKA the
hook) and TASKA hands are waterproof up to the electronic connection with
the wrist (though there are water-resistant wrists as well).
Some single-motor myoelectric electric hands will be covered with a cosmetic
glove. As long as that glove is intact, it is safe to rinse the fingers of the hand
lightly as long as you dry it off thoroughly. Please keep in mind that it’s
important to check the cosmetic glove for perforations or pinholes where water
could leak into the inside — ideally at the end of each day. Because some of
these holes can be easily missed, it’s also recommended to clean the device
with a moist cloth and sanitize with alcohol spray.
Some prosthetic terminal devices lend themselves to being covered by a latex
or surgical-type glove. This can allow the user to engage in a variety of food
prep, personal hygiene or child-care activities before throwing the disposable
latex glove away.Keeping Your Sound Hand Clean
If you want to be sure to get your sound hand nice and
clean, but you can’t use your terminal device to help wash your sound hand,
there are some helpful options available. First up, an automatic soap
dispenser (pictured to the left) means the sound hand can receive the soap
without any need for the other limb. Secondly, a scrub brush that is mounted
in the sink using suction cups. You can find small ones (pictured below)
and big ones (this link shows a picture of a foot with the brush, but it works
just fine for hands). On the go? You can take along a washcloth that you get
wet and squirt soap onto before manipulating it in your sound hand under the
water. Unfortunately, this requires thinking ahead to pack a washcloth in a
plastic bag, and really only gives you one shot at washing your hand. Another
option is wipes, like baby wipes.
Please keep in mind that the recommendation from the Centers for Disease
Control for hand washing is hot, soapy water and rubbing the hands together
for twenty seconds to help stop the spread of viruses Hand sanitizer should
only be used when running water is not available. But if you have a prosthetichand, we hope you’ll be able to use the advice above to keep you and your
loved ones as healthy as possible!

How to lose weight in a wheelchair,"How to lose weight in a wheelchair
Adults who use wheelchairs can find it harder to lose weight because they tend to use fewer
calories through physical activity. But there are still changes you can make to achieve a
healthy weight.
Being overweight or living with obesity puts you at higher risk of a range of serious health
conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.
How to check your weight
Body mass index (BMI) is a useful measure of whether someone is a healthy weight for their
height.
You can check your BMI by using our BMI healthy weight calculator.
However, it's sometimes not enough to use BMI to check the weight of someone in a wheelchair,
as this may not give the full picture.
If you're uncertain about your weight, talk to a GP. They will be able to tell you whether BMI is
suitable for you and whether you're currently a healthy weight.
The GP can also help if you're not able to weigh yourself.
Losing weight in a wheelchair
The average man needs around 2,500 calories a day to maintain his bodyweight. The average
woman needs around 2,000 calories a day.
If you're a wheelchair user, it's likely you'll need fewer calories than these guideline amounts.
This is partly because you tend not to use the large leg muscles. And having less muscle means
fewer calories are needed to maintain a healthy weight.
A GP or dietitian can help you to work out your daily calorie needs.
You may prefer to have the support of a community weight management service. You can ask
your GP if one is available near you, or you can refer yourself.
Information:Self-refer for help with your weight
If you need help managing your weight, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services
that can help you, without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
• ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
• check your GP surgery’s website
• contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
• search online for NHS weight management services near you
Anyone who wants to use the service, which welcomes wheelchair users, is screened by a
qualified weight management adviser who can tell you if the service is suitable.
For some people, a one-to-one programme may be available.
Tips for losing weight
Aim to lose between 0.5lb (0.25kg) and 2lb (1kg) a week until you reach your target weight. A
healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity will help you to maintain a healthy weight in
the long term.
It's important to eat a balanced diet from across the food groups shown in the Eatwell
Guide because, when you eat fewer calories, it can become more challenging to get enough
nutrients, especially vitamins and minerals, from your diet.
A healthy, balanced diet should be based on the Eatwell Guide. This means:
• eating at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day
• basing meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates
• choosing wholegrain with less added sugar, salt or fat, where possible
• having some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks and yoghurts) – choose lower-
fat and lower-sugar options
• eating some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein – aim for 2 portions of fish
every week, 1 of which should be oily, such as salmon, sardines or mackerel
• choosing unsaturated oils and spreads, such as sunflower or rapeseed, and eating them in
small amounts
• drinking plenty of fluids – the government recommends 6 to 8 cups/glasses a day – but try
not to have drinks just before meals to avoid feeling too full to eatIf you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in
small amounts.
However, it's important to remember that the Eatwell Guide is aimed at the general population.
Your dietitian or weight management adviser may have specific advice about portion sizes that
are adapted for your particular disability. But this will still be based on a healthy, balanced diet.
If you do not eat meat, find out how to have a healthy vegetarian diet or vegan diet.
Get active in a wheelchair
Regular physical activity helps to maintain a healthy weight, and it's also important for your
general health and wellbeing.
Whatever your level of physical ability, there will be an activity or sport for you.
Try to choose activities that improve your heart health and muscle strength.
If you can, try to do:
• at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity every week
• strength and balance exercises on 2 or more days a week
Aerobic activity is particularly important when it comes to losing weight. This is an activity that
raises your heart rate, gets you slightly out of breath and causes you to break a sweat.
If the gym appeals to you, there's a range of good options for wheelchair users. These can
include rowing machines adapted for wheelchair use, and weight machines for resistance
exercises.
The Activity Alliance runs the Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI), a scheme that ensures gyms are
suitable for use by people with disabilities. Find an inclusive gym on the Activity Alliance
website.
Other options include swimming or wheelchair sports such as:
• basketball
• netball
• badminton• boccia, which is a sport similar to bowls, in which leather balls are rolled towards a target
– find out more from Boccia England
WheelPower is an organisation that helps wheelchair users get involved in sport. Find out

How to Stretch Your Feet,"How to Stretch Your Feet
Your feet endure a great amount of stress each day from constantly allowing us to move around.
It is important to stretch your feet to help prevent them from becoming injured. Your toes may
easily deform into unhealthful positions if they are not stretched.
One of the most common reasons for toe deformities are the shoes you may be wearing. Shoes
that are too tight may fold and shift the toes out of place. Heeled shoes may also push your toes
upward. Forcing your toes into an unnatural position which may cause the muscles to tighten and
prevent them from reverting to normal length. Another common reason is improper use of foot
muscles. Many people fail to use the muscles in their feet or toes when they walk. Lastly, the
positioning of your feet while walking may also cause toe deformities. If you walk with your feet
facing outward, your “push-off” phase is on the side of your big toe instead of the bottom of your
foot. This may cause the big toe to eventually tighten into a new shifted position.
There are many reasons why stretching your toes may be helpful. One reason is that healthy
spacing may aid in avoiding calluses and other injuries that are caused by rubbing. Stretching
will also prevent you from developing toes that curl, hammertoes, or bunions.
A great way to stretch your toes is to place them in your hands and bend them all downward; this
will help you stretch the top of your foot. Next, you should repeat this process but instead bend
them upward enough to feel a nice stretch in the bottom of your foot. You should then try to pull
each toe apart from the next and pull any toes that are bent upward until they are back
downward.
If you are looking to practice stretching your entire foot, you can try a towel stretch. This is done
by sitting on the floor with your legs in front of you. Take a towel and wrap it around your toes.
Afterward, pull the towel toward you with your toes and hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds
before releasing. Practice this stretch for three sets. Another stretch your feet are towel lifts. This
is done by sitting in a chair and trying to pick a towel up from the ground with your toes. Try
lifting the towel with your little toes for five sets before switching feet.If you are an athlete, or exercise often, it is especially important for you to practice stretching
your feet. Those who suffer from foot pain caused by poor footwear, plantar fasciitis, or long
hours of standing at work may also benefit from foot exercises."
Let's stretch,"Let's Stretch the Right Way!
As we age, stretching becomes even more important. I integrate it into my routines, whether
before or after a training session or after a race.
Stretching plays a vital role in my training, both before and after a workout. I feel like stretching
regenerates my whole body.
Stretching involves a series of muscle-lengthening techniques designed to improve joint mobility,
which is defined as the capacity to stretch your joints to their maximum without pain. Stretching
exercises allow you to improve muscle length and elasticity.
For amputees, this is even more vital since it helps re-establish a new sense of equilibrium to
compensate for the loss of limb. Stretching keeps the various zones of the body toned and flexible,
helps prevent pain and reduces the chance of accidents during training sessions.
When carrying out stretching exercises, it is important both to work each part muscle group
individually (arms, thighs, etc.), as well as the the body as a whole, working all the kinetic chains
(particularly important to stretch the posterior kinetic chain).
In any case, all exercises need to be approached gradually. Whether you are working on muscle
strengthening exercises, stretching, or those aimed at improving proprioception, it is essential not
to proceed too brusquely, but to gently and progressively increase the intensity of the exercise,
both to keep from tiring too quickly and, more importantly, to avoid the chance of accidents.
Let’s take a look at some of the exercises Mira has integrated into his routine in training to compete
in triathlons (swimming, cycling, and running).STRETCHING - TRICEPS
• Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart
• Reach your right hand back between your shoulder blades
• Use your left hand to gently pull the right elbow
• Maintain the position for 15 to 30 seconds and then repeat on the other side
SIDE STRETCH
• Interlock your fingers and raise your arms straight up over your head, palms upward
• Stretch straight up and then as far over to the right as you can, stretching down your
left side
• Hold for 15 to 30 seconds and then switch sides. Repeat the sequence one to three
timesSIDE LUNGE STRETCH
• With your upper body straight and place your legs wide apart
• Shift your weight slowly to one side and bend your knee into a “lunge
• Hold the position for at least 30 seconds and then slowly shift your weight to the
same position on the other side
STANDING HAMSTRING STRETCH
• Hold on to something to keep your balance
• Raise one leg up onto a support and straighten it• Bend the knee of the standing leg slightly until you feel a gentle stretch
• Gently bend forward from your hips if you need more stretch
CALF STRETCH
• Stretch out your arms to hold onto a bar or touch the wall
• Put one foot forward and bend your knee, while you stretch the back leg keeping the
knee straight
• You should feel the calf muscle of your back leg
PROPRIOCEPTION
Proprioception is the awareness of the position of your own body in space, including being aware
of whether muscles are contracted or relaxed, without actually seeing it.
Exercises for proprioception increase balance, stability, and coordination, and therefore take on
particular significance for an amputee.
These exercises range from very easy (balancing standing on one leg, making a “bridge” with
one arm and one leg, etc.), to more difficult ones involving unstable surfaces (wobble and rocker
balance boards, Bosu balls, wobble cushions, etc.)."
Lower extremity recovery exercises,"Lower-Extremity Recovery: Exercises for Below-Knee Amputees
By MCOP Team August 13, 2019 living with your prosthetic, Amputee Support
Whether you’re preparing for or recovering from a below-knee amputation, there are a
number of amputee fitness routines out there to help you rebuild your strength, regain
your balance, and come closer to reclaiming a more active lifestyle.
Here, we’ll go over some of the most effective below-knee amputation rehabilitation
exercises that will be helpful to almost anyone, no matter how far along they are in
recovery.
Strength Training Exercises for Below-Knee Amputees
One effective strength-training exercise involves hanging weights from the residual part
of your amputated limb, then building up the weight capacity until it gets higher and
higher – in other words, a fairly typical weight-training procedure, only it’s been adapted
for a below-knee amputee.A good way to start out this exercise is by lifting your amputated limb with no weights at
all at first, moving it in as many directions as possible for as many times as possible.
After a while, and with your physical therapist and/or doctor’s permission, you can begin
adding more and more weight to heighten the intensity of your workout.
You should aim to progressively add more weight to continue challenging yourself, but
with only a certain amount of repetitions. Again, the exact amount is something you
should always clarify with your physician!
Amputee Balance Exercises for Below-Knee Amputations
Following a below-knee amputation, your balance will never be quite the same – and
that’s okay. It simply means you’ll need to retrain your brain to accommodate your new
situation and all that will take some practice. Your balance system is very complex, and
in little or no time, it can be compromised if it is not being used. The good news is that
your balancing muscle memory can be restored quickly with the right training and
activities. Of course, like with any other recovery-related exercises, all balance training
should be cleared by your physician or PT before starting.
With that said, you can help your brain adjust to your new normal by practicing very
simple activities, such as:
• Standing as much as during your daily activities such as brushing your teeth,
washing, doing the dishes, or even just loading the dishwasher.
• Reaching out for objects while sitting, kneeling down, or standing with even
pressure placed on your prosthesis for as long as possible.• Performing mini squats where you remain standing with even pressure on both
feet and your knee bent just a little bit. While doing this, attempt to turn from side
to side as many times as possible. Try this first without your prosthesis
(carefully), then again with your prosthesis.
Also, being able to balance on your prosthesis with the full weight of your body is
essential if you’re aiming to walk smoothly and confidently again. To help you
accomplish this, you can:
• Lean over while putting your weight onto your prosthetic leg for varying periods of
time. Try this while standing still or walking!
• Repeatedly (and gently) kick a ball across the room with your prosthetic leg.
• Roll a tennis ball back and forth and side to side under your foot on both sides.
See how quickly you can gain control over the ball using your balance.
• Hold onto a rail when lifting your non-prosthetic leg up to the step, then bring it
back down to the floor. Repeat as many times as possible (or as recommended).
• Practice balancing exclusively on your prosthetic leg, timing yourself each day
and trying to beat your record the next."

Prosthetic Cleaning Guide,"Prosthetic Cleaning Guide
Shrinkers and socks and liners OH MY! We are here to help you manage cleaning all of the
parts and items you will use with your prosthetic device. This blog post will talk you
through the steps of cleaning and maintaining these items. How often should you clean
these items? Everyday! It is important to keep up with the cleaning and maintenance of
your device, liners, and socks to reduce the amount of build-up on your prosthesis and
reduce your risk of getting irritated skin.
What You Will Need
1. Rag(s) or towel(s)
2. Warm water
3. Mild soap (non-irritating body soap)
4. Mild detergent
5. Rubbing alcoholHow to Clean Your Shrinker
You will be wearing your shrinker almost full-time following your amputation as it is
helping reshape your residual limb to best fit your prosthesis. For more information about
the purpose of the shrinker, you can check out our shrinker blog post here. The best way to
clean your shrinker is by hand using your detergent or mild soap and warm water. You can
fully submerge the shrinker in water and use your hands to gently clean the material. Then
you can hang your shrinker up overnight to let it dry by the morning.How to Clean Your Prosthetic Socks
Prosthetic socks are used over your liner to help maintain an appropriate fit of your
prosthesis throughout the day. Similar to your shrinker you can clean your prosthetic sock
by hand with warm water and soap. Some brands of prosthetic socks recommend that you
place them in your washer on a cold and gentle setting. You can then let the sock air-dry
overnight.How to Clean Your Liner
Your liner is placed directly on your skin to create a comfortable barrier between you and
your prosthesis as well as help keep your residual limb in the socket. At our office we
typically provide liners that have either a silicone or thermoplastic polymer elastomer(TPE) layer on the inside. You can get a buildup of skin cells, sweat, and debris from
wearing your liner daily so it is important that you clean the inside and outside of your
liner.
Steps to clean your liner daily:
1. Turn your liner inside out
2. Take a towel and wet it with warm soapy water
3. Using the towel gently clean the inside of your liner
4. Then you can use a dry towel to gently pat the liner dry
5. Roll your liner so the inner gel is back on the inside
6. Then hang your liner up over night to allow for it to fully dry
It is also recommended that you provide a more thorough clean of your liner about once a
week! For this you will also need to use rubbing alcohol. The rubbing alcohol can reduce
the risk of bacteria and fungus building up in your liner.
Steps to deep clean your liner weekly:
1. Turn your liner inside out
2. Take a towel and dip it in a rubbing alcohol solution
3. Gently clean your liner using the towel
4. Wash off the rubbing alcohol solution with warm water
5. If you have sensitive skin it is recommended that you then clean your liner with
another towel that has been dipped in a mixture of mild soap and warm water
similar to your daily clean
6. You can then use this towel with mild soap and water to gently clean the liner
7. Rinse off the liner with warm water
8. Roll your liner so the inner gel is back on the inside
9. Then hang your liner over night to dry
There are several products that you can use to hang your liner up over night. Some that we
like are:
• My Liner Buddy - this product is great if you have a liner with a pin
• Liner Drying Stand - there are many different brands and types of liner drying
stands. The link for this strand is one of the more affordable options.How to Clean Your Socket
Your socket is the part of your prosthesis that you place your residual limb in. It is created
to custom fit your limb for a comfortable and snug fit. Sockets are typically made out of a
special plastic that is lightweight but durable. You do not need to fully submerge your
socket to get it clean and this may damage some of the components on your socket overtime. You can use warm water, soap, and a towel to scrub your socket clean. Make sure to
clean the outside and inside of your socket thoroughly. You can either allow the socket to
dry overnight if you clean it before bed or you can dry it off with another towel. If you are
going to dry your socket off with a towel make sure it is completely dry before you put it
back on so that you are not trapping water inside of your socket. This can cause bacteria to
build up and skin irritation.
What about the rest of your prosthesis?Most terminal devices and pylons used on your prosthesis are weatherproof! This means
that you can get these areas of the prosthesis damp to wash them however, it is not
recommended that you fully submerge them in water or spray them with water as this can
damage them over time. Similar to cleaning your socket you can use warm water, a damp
towel, and a gentle soap to wipe down the rest of your prosthesis. That includes the foot if
you have a lower extremity prosthesis and the hand or other terminal end if you have an
upper extremity prosthesis.Bottom Line
It is important that you clean your shrinker, prosthetic socks, liners, and socket daily!
Regularly cleaning your device will reduce your risk of having skin irritation and building
up bacteria/other particles on your device. If you have any further questions or concerns
regarding cleaning your prosthesis or other components you can review the wear and care
guides provided with the item or on the manufacturers' website."
Since you rely on your residual limb and prosthetic device to move,"Since you rely on your residual limb and prosthetic device to move, it’s
important to know how to take care of both. A prosthesis is a
mechanical device that requires cleaning as well as regular prosthesis
maintenance by a prosthetist or technician.
As for your remaining limb, it will need to undergo a “shaping” process whereby your
healthcare provider will prescribe a compression stocking to shape it to fit the
prosthesis. Follow your doctor's recommendations, as they'll prescribe the best above-
knee prosthesis use and care for each amputee’s needs.
Below, our team at PrimeCare has put together a general guide on how to care
for prosthetics.
Limb Care
• New amputees should shower or bathe in the evening rather than the
morning, as hot water causes limbs to swell, which makes it more difficult to fit
prostheses. We recommend wearing a shrinker at first to compress your
remaining limb until such time you no longer need to.
• For both below-knee (transtibial) and above-knee amputations, post-artificial
limb care guidelines recommend avoiding the use of pillows under or
between the legs during sleep, as this can lead to difficulties in straightening
the knee or hip. This can affect mobility and comfort.
• Do daily stretching exercises recommended by your doctor. These
straighten the knee and hip to provide increased comfort when lying down and
walking. Although it might seem unnecessary, prosthesis daily stretching is
crucial for maintaining mobility!
Skin CareCare of residual limbs after amputation is vital. Make sure to participate in routine skin
care while using prosthetics; it's important to maintain the skin’s protective function.
Neglecting this can result in painful ulcers and serious infection, which affects
rehabilitation, comfort, and mobility.
Amputee Skin Problems
Skin complications are a common concern for amputees and require vigilant attention.
The enclosed environment created by prosthetic devices often leads to a range of skin
issues.
• Skin Irritation: Due to friction between the skin and the prosthetic device.
• Pressure Sores: Caused by the continuous pressure exerted by the prosthetic.
• Sweating and Odor: Due to lack of air circulation inside the prosthetic device.
• Fungal Infections: Often arise from a moist environment within the prosthetic.
• Skin Ulcers: A severe form of skin breakdown that can lead to infection.
• Redness and Inflammation: Signs that the fit or alignment of the prosthetic
device may need adjustment.• Dry Skin: Increases susceptibility to tears and cracks, becoming a portal for
bacteria.
Amputee Skin Care Tips
• Wash your limb once a day with mild soap and warm water, and pat it
completely dry to avoid fungal growth. It's important to change dressings
daily, or more often if they become saturated.
• Always examine your skin before and after wearing your prosthetic. If there
are signs of persistent redness, ulceration, tears, or scrapes, let your doctor and
prosthetist know immediately. If red patches last more than a few minutes after
you remove your prosthesis, this could be a sign your socket needs checking.
• As we noted, prosthetic skin care is essential. Because residual limbs are
enclosed in plastic sockets, perspiration is likely and normal. However, this can
also be a source of odor and bacteria. Sprinkling a small amount of powder can
help, as well as changing the prosthetic sock to keep things dry and comfortable.
Perspiration generally subsides with persistent prosthetic use.
• Consult your doctor before using lotions, ointments, or powders. These
may irritate the skin or cause inflammation. Be sure to hydrate your dry skin at
night when you're not using your prosthesis. Keeping your skin moisturized is
vital as dry skin is more fragile.
• Check your skin often, especially if you have decreased sensations. A
mirror may be helpful if you can't see your limb, and know that solutions for
excessive sweating are available.
• If you notice redness, callouses, irritation, blisters, and breakdown, or if
your prosthesis doesn't feel right, remove it and check your skin. Be sure to
tell your health care providers so they can help you remedy the issue or direct
you to the appropriate care. General skin irritation and allergic reactions are often
a result of soaps, cleansers, manufacturing chemicals, and lotions.
Remember, care of residual limb after amputation is an ongoing process and early
intervention can prevent complications.
General Prosthetic Care
Dos:• Clean Daily: Keep your prosthesis clean with a damp cloth and mild soap for
thermoplastic sockets and liners. For myoelectric prosthetics, wipe and leave
them to dry overnight.
• Wear Fresh Liners and Socks: To maintain hygiene, wear new liners and/or
socks every day to minimize bacterial growth.
• Inspect Daily: Give your prosthesis a quick once-over each day to catch any
wear and tear or loose components.
• See Your Prosthetist Regularly: Regular check-ups help ensure optimal
function of your prosthesis and keep you updated with the latest advancements.
• Store Carefully: Place prostheses in a secure location where they won't get
knocked over, and avoid storing them in direct sunlight, near ovens, or close to
radiators to protect against damage from a hot environment.
Don'ts:
• Avoid DIY Modifications: Don't make adjustments to your prosthesis yourself,
especially if it's making strange noises. Consult your prosthetist for any changes.
• Steer Clear of Water: Keep the device away from fresh or salt water to prevent
rusting and damage to sensitive components. If you can't avoid frequent contact
with water, consult your prosthetist about the option of a waterproof prosthesis.
• Don't Overexert: Take breaks as needed, especially during the initial phases of
rehabilitation, to avoid straining your limb.
• Avoid Leaving in Visible Spots in Cars: Don't leave your prosthesis completely
visible in your car to minimize the risk of theft and damage from heat.

Detailed Prosthetic MaintenanceUnderstanding how to care for a prosthesis is key to maintaining its longevity and
ensuring optimal performance. Below are specialized care guidelines tailored to
different types of prosthetic devices.
Socket and Prosthetic Liner Care
• Daily cleansing of the socket is important, especially when dealing with a
prosthetic leg. Use warm water and soap. If needed, use a scrub brush for hard-
to-reach spots.
• For prosthetic liner care, rinse off soap residue with a clean, damp cloth, and dry
the liner thoroughly. Allow it to air out overnight for optimal hygiene.
• To combat bacteria and reduce odors, spray the inner socket and prosthetic
exterior with rubbing alcohol and let it air dry.
Caring for Passive Devices
• Robust passive devices can be initially cleaned using compressed air to
eliminate debris. If approved, follow up with water and soap.
• More delicate passive devices should be sanitized only with rubbing alcohol and
stored in their designated boxes.
Body-Powered Devices
• Use compressed air to remove initial debris. You can add soap for a deeper
cleaning, ensuring that all soap residue is rinsed off.
• Focus on thorough drying to remove all moisture, especially if your device has
components susceptible to rust.
Myoelectric Device Care
• Myoelectric prostheses should never be submerged in liquid. Even sweat can
damage the wiring, which makes bi-annual maintenance essential.
• Exercise caution around charging ports and batteries to avert moisture-related
damage.
Cosmetic and Functional Add-Ons
• Inspect soft liners and rubber padding daily for wear and tear, and replace them
as necessary.• Cosmetic gloves are prone to staining. Be sure to clean them as needed and
report any cracks or cuts to your prosthetist.
Conclusion
Prosthetic rehabilitation is a journey, so be patient with yourself! New amputees should
take time to get used to wearing a prosthesis as they adjust to new maintenance
regimes and increased mobility. If you’re unsure how to take prosthetic care or have any
questions, always ask your doctor. They are qualified and attuned to your unique needs
and will recommend the best course of action.
If you’re an amputee requiring a new prosthetic or about to undergo an amputation, we
can help make your journey toward independence a success. For over a
decade, PrimeCare has provided residents in Las Cruces and surrounding areas with
cutting-edge prosthetics that improve their lives. Contact us for a no-obligation, initial

Tips on how to take care of your prosthetic leg
silicone liner and residual limbIt’s really important to consistently take good care of your prosthesis, liner
and residual limb. Good hygiene keeps you healthy and mobile and
ensures that you avoid skin irritations and injuries. By regularly cleaning
your residual limb, liner and prosthetic socket, you protect your skin from
inflammation and infection. It also increases the lifespan of your devices.
Let’s start with residual limb care.Regularly check your residual limb
The simplest and best way you can make sure your residual limb stays
clean and healthy is to check it regularly. That way, you can spot any
problems early.
Tips to help you:
• Use a mirror to check your residual limb from every angle.
• In the beginning, check your residual limb whenever you change your
dressing or take off your prosthesis.
• Later, one daily inspection after washing your residual limb should be
enough.
Cleanse and clean your skin
Wearing a prosthetic leg has an impact on your skin. The prosthetic liners
and sockets put pressure on the skin and make it harder for the skin to
regulate temperature. This can irritate the skin and even gather bacteria.
So you can keep your skin happy by cleaning it every day.
Here’s how:
• Clean your residual limb daily with a mild soap (pH neutral) or a
special cleansing lotion.
• Apply a moisturizing cream each evening, preferably at bedtime.
Desensitizing residual limb
After amputation, the skin on your residual limb will be sensitive to the
touch. Wearing a prosthetic leg then puts pressure on that skin, in new
places. There are a number of techniques you can use to help de-sensitize
your skin, prepare and strengthen it for its new role.For example, you can help your skin get used to different kinds of
materials by touching and rubbing it with your hands or items like, towels
and sponges.
Taking care of your prosthesis and prosthetic liner
You can think of your liner like a sock. It wraps around your skin every day
and so needs cleaning every day. You can do this by hand or in the
washing machine. So it’s a great idea to have at least two liners!
For hand washing:
1. Roll the liner off of your residual limb.
2. Turn the liner inside-out so that the silicone that is typically on the
inside is outside.
3. Thoroughly wash the silicone side with a mild (pH neutral) soap or
with a special liner cleaner.
4. Rinse off the soap entirely so there is no residue.
5. Dry the liner inside and out with a towel.
6. Turn the liner back its normal form so the silicone is on the inside and
clean the outside with a damp cloth.
7. Hang up the liner to dry completely. Never put it on directly on a
heater and avoid direct sunlight.
For machine washing:
1. Place the liner in a laundry bag (mesh bag).
2. Be sure to carefully follow the washing instructions.
3. Use a mild detergent and choose the gentlest cycle your machine
offers.
4. Dry the liner inside and out with a towel.
5. Turn the liner back its normal form so the silicone is on the inside and
clean the outside with a damp cloth.
6. Hang up the liner to dry completely. Never put it on directly on a
heater and avoid direct sunlight.Prosthetic leg care⁠—socket & textile components
• Prosthetic liner: A prosthetic liner is the sock you roll on to your
residual limb
• Socket: A socket is the hard top part of the prosthesis that is made to
fit your residual limb with liner
Socks are also sometimes used over the liner in case the volume of the
residual limb has changed, to compensate for the loss of volume
To keep your equipment in good working order, it is important to do
regular checks and keep items clean. Thanks to your prosthetic liner, your
skin doesn’t actually come into contact with your prosthetic socket.
You only need to wash your prosthetic socket once a week. However, if
your residual limb sits directly within the socket without a liner interface,
such as if you are using vacuum suction, it’s important to clean your
socket daily. This keeps your limb clean and healthy.
Here’s how:
1. Clean your prosthetic socket with water and pH neutral soap and then
leave it to dry.
2. Disinfect the socket with an alcohol spray.
Wash other textile components of your prosthesis at least 2-3 times a
week. BE sure to follow washing instructions carefully. Use a mild
detergent and choose the gentlest cycle your machine offers."

Welcome to Ottobock!
In this section, you will learn what to expect during the rehabilitation process
at our Center. Before the prosthetic fitting and rehabilitation process begins, our

Ottobock | Therapy and Rehabilitation for Arm Amputees 2526 Ottobock | Therapy and Rehabilitation for Arm Amputees4. Using the prosthesis
4.1. Myotest and Myotraining
Some modern myoelectric protheses allow you a targeted approach
to grasping objects. The relevant commands for these movements
are transmitted to the prosthesis by your residual limb muscula-
ture. A procedure known as Myotest is used to measure the stimu-
lus by determining the optimal positioning of the electrodes and
the signal strength.
The Myotest will be followed by the so-called Myotraining. Your
orthopaedic expert will for example ask you to strain a particular
muscle in order to open your hand. Known as myoelectric control,
the procedure is supported by a computer simulation used to visu-
alise motor functions. Based on the Myotest results and on subse-
quent myotraining, our experts will help you choose the prothetic
components suiting you best. Eventually the software controlling
your final prosthesis will be programmed accordingly (1).
Ottobock | Therapy and Rehabilitation for Arm Amputees 274.2. Correct Donning and Doffing
There are various ways to put on and take off your prosthesis depending
on the type of prosthesis and the characteristics of your residual limb.
Whether you have prosthetic fittings on one or both sides is a crucial point.
As you learn how to handle the prosthesis, your therapist will show you
which method is suitable for you (1).
You may moisturise your skin lightly before putting on the prosthesis. This
reduces skin resistance and improves conductivity between the muscles or
the skin and electrodes in the prosthetic socket. Without moisture, it may
take a moment before you achieve good contact between your skin and
the electrodes which is necessary in order to achieve optimum control over
your prosthesis.
4.3. Cleaning the Prosthesis
You have already learned how to care for your residual limb.
The prosthesis also has to be cleaned and cared for on a daily basis (2).
In order to remove residue from perspiration and skin particles, we
recommend to regularly wipe the inner socket of the prosthesis with a
damp cloth. Proceed likewise with your prosthetic glove according to the
care instructions and examine it for ruptures. If there are any, the glove
needs to be replaced.
If you are used to wearing a liner, daily care according to the instructions is
essential.

5.1. Physical Training with Prosthesis
Since an arm amputation always affects the sense
of balance as well, you will undergo balance and
coordination training. In terms of coordination train-
ing, practising coordination between the eye and
prosthetic hand is especially important, since
your lack of sensation will be substituted by visual
control.
5.2. Controls Training
You will be familiarised with the functions of your
prosthesis after it is fabricated. Depending on the
components used in your prosthesis, you now learn
how to open and close the hand and rotate it inwardly
and outwardly. Interchanging components will also be
part of your training (1).

5.3. Repetitive Drills
Automising the processes as best as possible, will free
your mind from constant worries about how to control
your prosthesis. That is how these processes – as far as
possible – are automated so that you do not have to
think about controlling the prosthesis as much and
develop endurance in tensing your musculature.
Suitable exercise accessories include cones, various peg
board games or a pinch tree with individual pegs (2),
which can be changed in their vertical or horizontal
positions. Rotating them, helps you to adapt your
gripping pattern to the changing conditions.

ADL training is tailored to your personal
needs. The exercises are selected according
to what is important to you at work or when
performing your daily activities.
Simpler activities like folding a towel are
meant to introduce you to more challenging
tasks like preparing a meal. Training may
also include getting dressed and undressed;
opening a bottle and pouring a drink (1) and
using items at the office. Being able to eat on

considered a major step towards regaining

Most toe stretches improve flexibility and mobility. Others also increase toe
strength. Some are good for specific conditions, such as bunions and plantar
fasciitis.
When you do the stretches in this article, you should feel the stretch in your
toes or other parts of your foot while taking care not to push or pull too hard or
overextend. These stretches work best with bare feet.
The goal for each stretch is to repeat it 10 times, but it’s ok to start with 2 or 4
repetitions and increase as tolerated.

2. Place a bottle of frozen water on the floor in front of you.
3. Place the sore foot on the bottle.
4. Roll the bottle around with your foot.
5. Continue for 1 to 2 minutes.18. Ball roll
While rolling the ball, focus on painful areas on the bottom of your foot.
1. Sit with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Place a golf or tennis ball on the floor in front of you.
3. Place the sore foot on the ball.
4. Roll the bottle around with your foot.
5. Continue for 1 to 2 minutes.
Stretches for hammer toe
A hammer toe bends downward at the middle toe joint. It usually affects the
second toe and is often due to wearing tight or pointy shoes.
19. Toe pull
This stretches the bent joint, helping the bones move back to their normal
position. It should be done gently.
1. Sit with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Lift your right leg and place your ankle on your left thigh.
3. Slowly and gently pull the bent toe down, stretching the joint. Hold for 5
seconds.
4. Repeat 10 times on each affected toe.
The toe curl and marble pick up stretches described previously are also
helpful for hammer toe.Staying on your feet
The bones in your toes are called phalanges. Each of your toes is made up of
two or three phalanges. Moving from your toenail toward your foot, they are
called distal, middle, and proximal phalanges. Your second through fourth
toes have all three. Your big toes only have two: distal and proximal.
Joints are where two bones connect. The joints of your toes also include
where your toe bones connect to the next bone in your foot, which are called
metatarsals.
Inside the joints, cartilage at the ends of the bones allows them to slide
smoothly against each other when they move. Your body creates a lubricant
called synovium that helps the bones move more easily.
There aren’t any muscles in your toes. Their movement is controlled by
tendons and ligaments that connect your toes to muscles in your foot and
legs.

What are the benefits of toe
stretches?
Your toes are small but important parts of your body. They help you walk, run,
stand, and support all of your weight when you’re on your feet.
Being on your feet all day, being a runner or athlete, and wearing tight shoes
can cause your toes to:• go out of alignment
• cramp
• become painful
• lose flexibility
• be at increased risk for injury
Some conditions are associated with heavy use of your feet and tight shoes.
These include:
• bunions
• hammer toe
• plantar fasciitis
With or without these problems and conditions, stretching your toes can be
beneficial. Stretching can help your toes become:
• realigned
• relaxed
• less painful
• more flexible
• less tired
•
Stretching won’t get rid of bunions, hammer toe, or plantar fasciitis but it may
help symptoms and bring you relief."

Abstract
Background
Limb loss occurs due to different causes and has been increased in many
countries. It has without exception, great economic, psychological and
social impacts.
Objectives
This study assesses the demographics of amputees in one city of Iran.
Patients and Methods
This retrospective study was undertaken on all of the amputees between
April 2002 and December 2011. Patients’ demographics including age,
sex, the amputated limb, etiology of limb loss and level of amputation
were recorded.
Results
We had 216 patients in the study. The average number of amputations
was 21.6 per year and varied from 14 to 32. The mean age of amputation
was 39.26± 12.6 years. Of the patients, 172 were male (79.62%) and 44
female (20.37%); 119 of the amputations (55.09 %) were major and 97
minor (44.9 %). The most common cause of amputation was trauma andthe most common was the toe. In trauma patients the mean age was
38.12± 10.25 years and 98 (83.7%) were male.
Conclusions
In contrast to similar studies in developed countries, trauma was found
to be the major cause of all types of amputations. Results of this study
may be used in prevention planning.

1. Background
Limb amputation is one of the most ancient of all surgical procedures
with a history of more than 2500 years dating back to the time of
Hippocrates (1). It has many cases such as trauma, peripheral vascular
disease, tumor, infection and congenital anomalies (2, 3). Amputation is
the last resort when limb salvage is impossible or when the limb is dead
or dying, viable but nonfunctional or when it is threatening the patient's
life (1). Limb loss often has profound economic, social and psychological
effects, especially in developing countries where the prosthetics are poor
(4-6). Major limb amputations beside high perioperative mortality are
disfiguring (7). In Western countries, rise in amputations is for the most
part due to increased life expectancy. According to the newest statistics
in the USA, about 1.7 million people live with amputations (8), and the
number has increased in the recent years (9). It is estimated that 25–27
in 100,000 of the German population have undergone amputation (10).
The incidences of different pathologies leading to limb amputation have
been reported to vary in different populations. In developed countries
peripheral vascular disease is the major cause; whereas, trauma,
infections, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and malignancies are the
leading causes for amputation in developing countries (11, 12). Most
amputees in developed countries elderly patients with vascular
problems (7, 13-15). However in the developing countries, most patients
with amputation are young and the major cause of limb amputationvaries from one hospital to another. For patients, knowledge of their
health condition or disease plays an important role in improving the
quality of life (16).

We studied the epidemiology of amputees in Zahedan, over a 10-year
period.

3. Patients and Methods
This retrospective chart study was performed by referring at two major
teaching and referral hospitals of Zahedan. The records of patients
amputated from April 2002 to December 2011were reviewed, and data
including age, sex, amputated limb, the level, and the cause of
amputation was obtained.
Amputations were divided into two groups: major, above the wrist on
the arm or above the ankle on the leg, and minor, below the wrist or
ankle. The main cause of amputation was considered. For qualitative
data, statistical evaluations were performed by Chi-square test and
quantitative variables were compared between groups using the
Student’s t-test. Data was analyzed using SPSS 15 software. A P-value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Go to:
4. Results
A total of 216 patients were studied, of whom 198 were amputated for
the first time and 18 were amputated more than once. The average
number of amputations was 21.6 per year and varied from 14 to 32. Mostamputations were performed in 2003 (Figure 1). Patients’ ages varied
between 3 and 73 years and, on average, 39.26 ± 12.6 years; 172 patients
were male (79.62%) and 44 female (20.37%). Figure 2 shows sex
distribution of amputation based on the etiology. The average age of men
at amputation was less than that of women; 38.15 ± 12.2 years in
comparison to 43.4 ± 14.4 (P = 0.014). Figure 3 shows the age group
distribution based on the etiology.
Figure 1.

Age Group Distribution of Amputation Based on the Etiology
The lower limb (172 cases or 79.62%) was amputated more than the
upper limb (40 cases or 16.51 %). Major amputations comprised 55.09%
of all amputation procedures (119 cases), and 44.9% were minor (97
cases). Of all the major amputations, 97 cases (81.51 %) occurred in
men, as did 75 cases of minor amputations (77.31 %). The association
between two sexes and major and minor amputations was not
statistically significant (P = 0.49).
Of the upper limb amputations, 62.8 % (49 cases) were major and 37.17
% (29 cases) minor. In the lower limb, 51.44 % of amputations were
major (71 cases) and 48.55% minor (67 cases), and this was not
statistically significant (P = 0.141). The most common cause of
amputations was trauma (117 cases or 54.16%). Diabetes in 57 patients
(26.38%) was the second cause of amputation; 23 (10.46%) had severe
obstruction of blood vessels with or without gangrene or vascularembolism. The remainder of the amputations were due to infections
(osteomyelitis or fasciitis) in 9 (4.1%), soft tissue sarcoma (1.84%),
osteogenic sarcoma (1.38%), melanoma (0.46%), squamous cell
carcinoma of skin (0.46%), and congenital anomalies (0.46%) (Figure
4).Among the amputations, above-the-knee amputations and toes were
more common than others (56 cases (25.92%) and 54 (25%)
respectively). Both major and minor amputations were more prevalent
in the lower limbs. All of patients with diabetic causes had lower
extremity amputations. Of the 18 patients who were amputated more
than once, 8 patients were cases of trauma, 6 patients had diabetes, and
4 had vascular diseases. The average age of these patients was 42.15 ±
11.5 years. When trauma was the cause, the mean age of the patients was
38.12 ± 10.25 years (range from 3 to 66); ninety eight (83.7%) were
male while 19 (16.23%) were female. The median time from trauma to
hospital admission was 48 minutes (range from 5 minutes to 8 hours).
Sixty-five cases were results of blunt trauma (59.09%), 30 (27.27%)
were from penetrating injuries, and 15 (13.63%) had burns (9 electrical
burn and 6 thermal burn) as the cause of amputation. Of all trauma-
caused amputations 65 (55.55%) were major and 52 (44.44%) minor. In
major amputations 45 (69.23%) were in lower limb and 20 (30.76%) in
upper limb, while in minor amputations 44 (84.61%) were in upper limb
and 8(15.38%) in lower limb. The toes (36.36%), above knee amputation
(36.36%) and fingers (27.27%) were the common levels of amputation.
In trauma patients76 (69.09%) had associated injuries. 43 (39.09%) had
injuries to other extremities, 34 (30.9%) injuries to head and neck,16
(14.54%) injury to thorax, 9 (8.18%) abdominal injury, and 6 (5.45%)
pelvic injury. The median of hospital stay was 3 days, ranging from 1 to
54 days. Of 216 patients 12 (5.55%) died; 3 had vascular cause of
amputation, 3 diabetic, and 4 had trauma with other associated injury,
and 2 were IV drug abuser with fasciitis. Postoperative complications
occurred in 56 (25.92%) of patients. Surgical site infection (SSI) was the
most common postoperative complication occurring in 38 (17.59%) of
patients. Amputation revisions were done for 18(8.33%) while 16
(7.4%) had wound hematoma, 10 (4.62%) phantom pain, 7 (3.24%)
wound dehiscence, and 4 (1.85%) stump gangrene.Figure 4.

5. Discussion
Limb amputation is a common surgical procedure performed by
orthopedic, general, vascular and trauma surgeons for therapeutic
reasons to save lives; it has profound economic, social and psychological
effects (1). Due to the differences in indications and patterns of
amputation between different countries and even different cities in a
country, this study was performed to describe our experiences on limb
amputations in two teaching hospitals and compare the findings with
similar studies in other parts of the world. This may help health services
recognize, plan and practice preventive strategies.In our study the males were dominant (79.62%).In another study that
was performed in Kerman, another city in Iran, 81.4% of patients were
male (16). The male dominance among patients in the present study
agrees with the findings by other authors (4, 17).It seems that because
the most common cause of amputation in our study and Mousavi's study
(16) was trauma which occurs more in males this can explain the greater
occurrence of amputation in males. Most of our patients were in the 4th
and 5th decades which is comparable with other studies (4, 7, 17),but is
in contrast with another study in Ghana which reported high peak age
incidence in the 7th decade (18). Other studies reported even lower peak
age incidence (19). In the study by Mousvi's et al. most patients were in
3rd and 4th decades of age and the most common cause of amputation,
like our study, was trauma. In a study by Moini amputation in trauma
patients were in 3rd and 4th decades of age as well (20). Differences in
the causes and patterns of amputation which is variable between
different countries can explain these age differences .The younger age in
our study might be due to trauma which is the most common cause. The
number of amputations performed during the 10-year period, except for
1 year (2003), did not demonstrate a sharp increase or decrease.
Considering that the population studied increased over the span of years
studied, the rate of amputations probably decreased during the study
period. On the other hand, the decrease in amputations performed at the
teaching hospitals may also have resulted from the construction of
several private surgery centers and other governmental hospitals that
began operating during the years of the study. In several studies,
complications of diabetic foot ulcers were the most common indication
for major limb amputation, followed by trauma and peripheral vascular
diseases (7, 18, 21). These findings are not in agreement with other
studies which reported trauma as the most common indication for limb
amputation (17, 20, 22).In our study, like others in Iran (16), found the
major cause of limb amputation to be trauma. Tumors and congenital
deformities were the causes of only a low percentage of amputations in
our study (10 cases (4.62%)). This may be due to scientific progress and
the prevention of amputations from these causes, or it may be due to the
fact that amputation is reserved for very advanced cases, especially of
the upper limb (23). Most of our amputations were performed in thelower limbs like other studies (4, 16). This finding is in agreement with
earlier findings that lower extremities are injured more often than the
upper extremities and diabetic gangrene is common in the lower
extremities than elsewhere on the body (3, 24, 25). All of patients with
diabetics had lower extremity amputations in our study. Several studies
reported that below knee amputation was the most common procedure
performed (4) and some reported transmetatarsal level as the most
common level of amputation (16), but other studies reported above knee
amputation as the most common procedure performed (17, 26). The
complication rate (25.92 %) in our study was lower compared to that of
Essoh et al. (39%) (4) and Chalya (33.3%) (27). Surgical site infection
was the most common complication like other studies (4, 27). The
mortality rate in the present study (5.55 %) is lower than what reported
in other studies (4, 17, 27). The reasons for high mortality rate in other
studies are diabetic-related complications, wound sepsis and advanced
malignancies with metastasis which were found to be common in our
study, but in our study mortality was lower because our patients were
younger and trauma was the major cause of amputation which occurred
in otherwise healthy people. In conclusion, this study showed the
epidemiology of limb loss in Iran is mostly due to trauma.

definitely should not stop you from being your fittest self!
Getting fit may be the last thing in your mind because of the limited
mobility that a wheelchair offers. The good news is that there are some
exercises you can do while you’re in your wheelchair. These wheelchair
exercises can help you do a number of things like:build strength, endurance and flexibility,
•
lose weight,
•
decrease joint or muscle pains,
•
prevent injury,
•
improve range of motion, and
•
get your muscles toned.
•
All in all, exercising even while in a wheelchair can help improve your
health.
Are you ready?
Here they are:
Get fit with these Top 10 Wheelchair
Exercises
1. Arm RaisesSince being in a wheelchair requires the constant use of your arms, you
need to perform an exercise that targets this body part.
Arm raises are a good exercise to start with your wheelchair exercise
because it’s easy and you can add weights for strength training.
Here’s how:
1. Hold a small handheld weight or a medicine ball to your chest.
2. Keeping your arms straight, raise it over your head.
3. Afterwards, bend your arms and go back to your original position.
4. Do this for 12 to 15 reps.
5. For better strength training of the arms, you can add more
weights. Just make sure that you don’t strain your arms too much from
holding too much weight.
2. Side Twists Wheelchair Exercises
Another good exercise for people in wheelchairs is side twists.
All you need is your body and you can strengthen your core by doing
the following:
1. Sit straight in your wheelchair.2. Twist your body first on the left (or the right if you prefer it).
3. Go back to your original position then twist your body on the other
side.
4. Do this for at least 12 to 15 reps.
3. Medicine Ball Criss-Cross
This is a cross of the first two exercises, arm raises and side twists.
Only this time, you need a medicine ball in your hands or a 10-20-pound
ball, whichever works for you.
Here’s how you can do this exercise:
1. Sit straight then lift the medicine ball above your head.
2. Lean over to one side.
3. Bring the medicine ball down across your body so that it’s across the
opposite hip. This only means that if you leaned to the right while doing
Step #2, your medicine ball should be over by your left hip.
4. Just repeat this routine with the opposite hip (right hip, left lean) and
vice versa.
5. Do this for at least 5 reps or more if you feel up to it.One of the benefits of this workout is that it not only strengthens your
arm muscles, it also works out your core strength and abs!
A helpful reminder when using weights
Weights should be used with care and proper guidance. That is to say,
weights should be challenging, but not straining. Start with smaller
weights then move on to heavier weights as you build strength and
endurance.
If you think you’re still not strong enough, it’s okay. The more you
exercise, the stronger you’ll get. The stronger you are, the more you’ll be
able to graduate to heavier weights.
4. Aeroplane Arms
This exercise is like child’s play. But it’s actually helpful in building your
arms’ strength.
Here’s how you can do this:
1. Sit straight in your wheelchair. Make sure you keep your back straight.
2. Extend your arms straight out on your sides.3. Starting slow, create circular movements with your arms. You can
start with small circular movements if your arms tire out easily before
moving to bigger circular movements.
4. Aim for at least 20 reps, first going clockwise and counterclockwise or
vice versa.
5. Sitting Bicycle Crunches
If you’re up for a more challenging exercise, then this is perfect for you.
Here’s how you can do it:
1. Sit with your back straight.
2. Put your palms together in your chest as if you’re about to tell a yoga
teacher, “Namaste.”
3. Angle your forearms so that they’re parallel to your lap.
Take note: If it helps with your balance, you can interlace your fingers
instead of just resting your palms together.’
4. Twist your body so that your right elbow touches your left knee.
5. Straighten up to your original position.6. Twist your body again, but this time use the opposite elbow touching
your opposite knee.
7. Do this for at least 5-8 reps.
This exercise not only works out your abs but also your obliques!

6. Knee or Toe Lifts Wheelchair Exercises
You may be in your wheelchair but developing leg strength is still
important. If you still have some mobility in your legs, you can do knee
lifts to build strength in your legs.
You can do this simply by lifting your knees up as high as you can.
Depending on where you are in your strength training, you can either
hold this position for as long as you can. If you can’t do this, you can do
reps of knee lifts.
If you’re not able to lift your knees, you can do toe lifts instead.
Here’s how:1. Lift the toes of your right (or left) foot while keeping the other flat on
the floor.
2. Hold the position for 3-5 seconds.
3. Lower your toes then repeat the process on your other toe.
4. Do this for at least 10-15 reps.
If you’re not able to move your legs at all, you can still increase blood
flow and strengthen your legs by moving them with your arms.
Bend down and touch your toes. Grab them firmly and lift them in reps
or hold them up for as long as you can. The choice is up to you. You can
also do the same thing by bending down and grabbing your knees.
7. Chest Stretch
Next on our list of wheelchair exercises is the chest stretch.
Since you spend most of your time sitting down, maintaining a good
and proper posture is still a must.
Sitting on a wheelchair does not make use of your back muscles which
can make it weaker over time due to inactivity. The repeated motion of
pushing your wheelchair also means that your chest and shoulder
muscles can become sore or stiff.Sore or stiff muscles can lead to injury. This is why it’s a good idea to
exercise your chest and your back with a bit of stretching every day to
help prevent injury.
Here’s how you can do this exercise:
1. Sit upright in your wheelchair. Make sure that your back is not
touching the backrest of your chair.
2. Extend your arms out on your side then pull your shoulders back.
3. Gently and slowly push your chest forward until you feel your chest
muscles stretching.
4. Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds to avoid straining.
5. Repeat this for at least 5 reps.
Doing this exercise every day can give be very good to keep your
posture straight and strong.
8. Engage in some wheelchair sports.
You may be thinking it’s impossible, but people in wheelchairs can still
be active by playing sports.
Some sports like basketball, badminton and netball are just some of the
holistic exercises that you can try.
Playing any of these can improve your cardiovascular endurance and
strengthen your muscles.
9. Arm Bike Machine
If you need a good dose of cardio exercise without hurting your knees
or your legs, arm bike machines would be a great option.Also known as an upper-body ergometer, the arm bike exercises the
muscles in your arms, back, shoulders and even your core. You can
consider it a packaged workout since it helps you develop strength
while at the same time strengthen your heart and your lungs.
This helps you save time doing two types of wheelchair workouts at the
same time.
All you have to do is sit on the arm bike machine and get your heart
pumping after 10-20 minutes.
Gyms like Special Strong offers more exercise machines like this for
people on wheelchairs. If you want to start on your fitness journey even
on a wheelchair, you can get your pass here to get access for 7 days.
10. Stretch out!
Stretching may look too simple to be considered an exercise. But
stretching is very important before and after you do any type of
wheelchair exercise.
In fact, stretching improves your mobility and also helps with flexibility.
You can stretch your arms, your legs, and even your neck. Move your
arms back and forth. Shake your wrist or your fingers. Just remember to
be gentle when you do stretches.

Wheelchair Exercises Reduces Stress and
Anxiety
Wheelchair exercise has been found to be effective in reducing stress
and anxiety levels in individuals with mobility limitations. Regularexercise has been a proven method of reducing stress and anxiety in
the general population, and the same benefits can be achieved
through wheelchair exercise.
Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins, which are natural
chemicals in the body that help improve mood and reduce stress. This
is especially important for individuals with mobility limitations, as they
may experience higher levels of stress and anxiety due to their
decreased ability to move freely.
Wheelchair exercise can provide a range of benefits for both physical
and mental health. It can help improve cardiovascular health, increase
muscular strength and endurance, improve flexibility, and improve
overall mood. Regular exercise can also lead to better sleep, which can
further reduce stress and anxiety.
There are many different types of wheelchair exercises that can be
done to achieve these benefits, including strength training, cardio
exercises, and stretching routines. It is important to consult with a
healthcare professional or a certified exercise specialist to develop a
safe and effective exercise program tailored to individual needs and
capabilities.

Upper Body Strengthening After Amputation,"Upper Body Strengthening After
Amputation
As you recover from amputation, you’ll need to keep your upper body strong. This will help you
move between surfaces, such as your bed and wheelchair. A physical therapist will teach you
exercises to strengthen your upper body. You may begin working with the physical therapist
before or after your surgery. You’ll need to keep doing these exercises once you go home.
Follow all instructions from the physical therapist or healthcare provider closely. If you have any
questions, be sure to ask. Below are some of the exercises you may learn.
Starting position
The following exercises can be performed in a sturdy chair without wheels or a wheelchair with
the wheels locked. Make sure your residual limb is supported and straight, not bent or dangling.

One of the most effective ways to recover from an upper-extremity amputation is to
find a challenging, yet realistic fitness routine to adhere to.
Here, you’ll find some of the most easy-to-follow exercises that upper-extremity
amputees can try out from the comfort of their own homes, their local gyms, or virtually
anywhere else they wish.Just make sure you get approval from a certified professional before starting any new
amputee fitness routine, and you should be good to go!
Upper Extremity Amputation Exercises
Just like any other type of amputee, those who have undergone an upper-extremity
amputation have to keep their bodies strong as they continue their journey back to an
active lifestyle. However, the workouts and training regimens available to them can vary
quite drastically based on the exact type of amputation-in-question, but that shouldn’t
deter you. There’s always something to choose from!
Regardless of whether you have a hand-, wrist-, elbow- amputation, or shoulder-related
amputation, you’ll have no problem finding some realistic exercise options of varying
intensities to choose from. With that said, here are some of the most popular, practical,
and effective upper extremity amputee exercises for you to consider!
• Resistance Training: When it comes to resistance training, one of the most
common and easy-to-execute routines is the “tug of war” method, where an
elastic band is tied to a strong and sturdy object and then pulled in all directions
with the prosthetic arm. Try starting in a seated position, then kneeling, and
eventually work your way up to standing.
• Strengthening Shoulders: Another upper-arm strength-training exercise is the
shoulder shrug, where the amputee strengthens his or her back muscles, in turn
supporting residual function. Begin by placing your feet on the ground and sitting
up strength, then bring your shoulders slowly to your ears before letting them
drop down to a neutral position. Repeating this multiple times (as much as four
sets of 15 repetitions) will assist you in relearning control of your arm.• Weight Training: With the appropriate sports prosthetic device, you’ll be able
to engage in any number of weight-based strength-training exercises, even if
you’re missing a hand! In fact, specially designed prosthetics, such as the Black
Iron Trainer, Black Iron Master, and the Black Iron Lite have all been custom-
tailored to fit the needs of different types of upper-extremity amputees, and each
variation can provide a myriad of capabilities, ranging from lightweight fitness
routines to aerobic machine exercises to competitive weightlifting.
• Casual Exercises: In addition to the more specific (and often more intense)
exercises listed above, upper extremity rehabilitation can also include more
subtle practices, including things as simple as stretching your shoulder and
elbow repeatedly to slowly strengthen your arm muscles. In fact, this simple,
easy-to-do-from-anywhere routine has become a very common routine for recent
amputees in the earliest stages of rebuilding their strength – and that’s because
it works!

upper limb daily care,"We get it. You are tired at the end of the day. You still have to change into
your PJs, brush your teeth, wash your face — it’s hard to add another thing to
the list. But we can tell you that by taking care of your device with the few
simple steps below, your prosthesis will work better and last longer.
Be sure to also keep up on regular maintenance appointments as well — keeping
your device in the best shape you can will ensure it’s there for your when you
need it! Of course, please also follow the directions that came with your
device, and what your prosthetic team has told you.
Socket Care:
• Wipe out your socket every day using soap and warm water. If
necessary, use a scrub brush to get in there, especially if the socket is
too narrow to reach into.
• Wipe out your socket a second time with a clean, damp cloth to remove
all traces of soap residue.
• Dry the inside of your socket thoroughly and allow it to air out overnight.
• To prevent bacterial growth and to minimize odor, it is recommended
that you wipe the outside of the prosthesis and the inside of the socket
with rubbing alcohol daily. Placing some in a spray bottle makes it easy
to apply. Allow it to air dry and make sure that it is completely dry before
putting it on. Dampness can cause skin to stick, rub and become
irritated.
Passive:
• Some passive prosthetic devices are sturdier than others. Again, follow
the directions you were given.
• More delicate passive devices should only be cleaned using rubbing
alcohol before being stored in their box when not in use.
• For sturdier passive devices, you can use compressed air to start – that
will blow away a lot of the debris. Then they can be cleaned with water.
If your instructions allow you to use soap, be sure to rinse well.
Body-Powered:
• Body-powered devices are known for being the sturdiest of all devices,
but they should still be cared for.• You can use compressed air to start — that will blow away a lot of the
debris.
• You can usually use soap on a body-powered device. Be sure
to wipe your prosthetic socket (the inside) at the end of the day, rinse
well to remove any soap residue, then make sure to either use
compressed air to dry it or let it dry in a way where any water can drain
and evaporate completely. Some parts of your device may not be made
of stainless steel and may rust if left wet.
• The frame (outside) of your prosthesis can be wiped down and even
scrubbed if necessary.
Externally Powered/Myoelectric Care:
• Never submerge any part of your electric prosthesis in any liquid unless
specifically indicated by your prosthetist.
• Know that sweat can damage the electrical wiring in your device but
visiting your prosthetist twice a year for regular maintenance can
prevent the damage from becoming permanent.
• Avoid getting any moisture in or around the charging port or battery.
• If available, you can use compressed air to start – that will blow away a
lot of the debris.
• Electrodes may be cleaned in a similar manner as the socket, but the
cloth should not have excessive water on it.
• When turning a myoelectric prosthesis off for the day, the hand or
terminal device should be in an open position. Batteries should be
removed and charged. If there is an internal battery, be sure the
prosthesis is switched off and then plug in the battery charging cord
leading from an electrical outlet.
• Some cosmetic gloves stain easily so it is best to avoid glove contact
with ink, newsprint, mustard, grease, dirt and other staining materials.
Clean the glove daily or when soiled with a damp cloth or sponge but
avoid immersing the glove in water. Rubbing alcohol or a waterless
hand sanitizer should also be used to eliminate bacteria.
• If there are cuts or cracks in the glove, be especially careful with liquids,
sand, dirt or anything else that could get to the electronic and
mechanical equipment under the glove. Inform your prosthetist when a
new glove needs to be ordered and applied.
• Inspect the prosthesis daily for worn or frayed areas, loose components,
cable issues or other prosthetic problems. Contact your prosthetist if
repairs are needed.If your prosthesis includes a harness, the harness should be cleaned daily,
rinsed well and allowed to air dry thoroughly.
In a pinch, even a baby wipe or even disinfecting wipe can be used to help
clean your prosthesis. Remember that by cleaning your prosthesis, you are
helping it go the distance.

Weightlifting for Arm Amputees
Many amputees keep in shape through weightlifting. If you are just starting out, it is important to discuss
the exercises you would like to do with your prosthetist and a trainer; they can help you customize
exercises for each piece of equipment (free weights, dumbbells, bench presses, etc.) to ensure you can safely
use the equipment with your artificial limb(s) or special device(s) and make sure the muscles in your residual
limb(s) are being appropriately exercised. Weight training can improve range of motion and muscle strength
and help with balance. Everyone works up a sweat at the gym, so it is important to ensure your suspension is
secure with your artificial limb(s) or device(s).
What follows are a few examples of weightlifting devices.
Grip, Black Iron Master, Black Iron Trainer and
Black Iron Light
TRS offers the Grip 2S and Grip 3 prehensors. These terminal
devices can be modified to accept a locking pin accessory for holding
weights in place. The TRS Black Iron Master is designed for serious
heavy-duty and professional weightlifters. It is manually secured with
a wing nut and has no quick release or other break-away features.
Once clamped in place, it stays until manually released.
For a lighter-duty weightlifting device, TRS has the

One of the inquiries we receive most when potential patients contact us is
asking how they can start or resume weightlifting. We get it! A partial hand
limb difference makes it difficult to properly lift even small hand weights or to
grip a barbell or the handles of weight machines — a higher level limb
difference can make it difficult for someone to know where to start. Balance is
a big part of weightlifting and if you’re not balanced, you can quickly find
yourself with some pretty serious asymmetry and overuse issues.
Many heavy-duty passive and body-powered partial hand prostheses can
handle weightlifting without needing to make a lot of adjustments. PointDesign digits and Naked Prosthetics both offer options that people can use
during their weightlifting regimen. However, if your amputation level is such
that an activity-specific device would be more helpful, that is an option as well.
Custom-built device made of durable materials combined with a BOA
system that makes it easy to dial in how tight or loose the socket feels.
There are many options for people who are looking for a weightlifting device
including the JAWS, black iron trainer, TAD weightlifting device, and the Multi-
D pivot, to name a few. Angel is a below elbow congenital amputee who uses
a variety of terminal devices to support her varied workouts. Not only can she

What Are the Different Types of Prosthetics,"What Are the Different Types
of Prosthetics?
Prosthetics
By
Eddie Zepeda
There are different types of prosthesis designed to function — and
sometimes look like natural arms, legs, hands, and
feet. Today’s Prosthesis options are lightweight, more comfortable,
and technologically advanced, offering a wide range of motion.
To realize how empowering these devices are, one needs only think of Paralympian athletes and
their incredible feats. So, what is the most common type of prosthetic? Mainly arms and legs. In
this blog, our team at PrimeCare explain the diverse styles and their capabilities.
What Is a Prosthesis?The National Library of Medicine describes a prosthesis as “a device designed to replace a
missing body part or to make a part of the bodywork better. Missing limbs and joints are
commonly replaced by prosthetic devices.”
There are many types of prosthetic devices to help people regain mobility. They fall into four
main categories; transradial, transhumeral, transtibial, and transfemoral. Each serves a different
function depending on what body part is missing.
Prosthesis vs. Prosthetic
While they sound similar, these two terms are not the same. Prosthetics refers to the field of
research and expertise in designing and building artificial limbs. It can also be used as an
adjective, for example, prosthetic limbs.On the other hand, a prosthesis refers to an artificial device built to replace a missing body part.
The plural of a prosthesis is prostheses. These devices are worn by people who have lost limbs or
those born with congenital limb differences.
Lastly, a prosthetist is a specialist whose profession entails developing prostheses and helping
patients who need artificial devices.
How Do Prosthetics Work?
Today’s prosthetic types offer amputees a wide variety of choices when it comes to function and
purpose. Upper extremity amputees may choose to use a passive prosthetic, which has a little
function apart from providing a natural appearance. Then there are three differently powered
types of prosthesis.
• Body powered: This is where the body controls the prosthetic. For instance, a cable may
move from one shoulder to the prosthetic hand, so the prosthetic activates as you move
your shoulder.
• Motor powered: These prosthetics have buttons to control movement. A prosthetic hand,
for example, may have a specific button to articulate wrists and fingers for gripping
objects.
• Myoelectric Powered: This new technology allows for the powering of prosthetic limbs
by electrical signals sent via electrodes placed on the skin.
Artificial limbs attach to the amputee's residual limb (stump) by belts, cuffs, or suction. Either
the residual limb fits directly into a socket on the prosthetic, or a liner is used that’s fixed to the
socket by vacuum or a pin lock.

Benefits of Prosthetics
For many people, the current prosthesis options improve quality of life by providing mobility
needed to manage daily activities. Lower extremity prosthetics allow people to walk, run, and
play sports. With increased movement, people gain greater independence and confidence and
live fuller lives without feeling socially anxious or burdened by physical challenges.
Selection Factor for Prosthetics
The selection of prosthetic types for patients depends on:
• Life aspirations
• The amputated body part
• The location of the body part
• The extent of the surgery
• The condition of the residual body part
A prosthetist can create an artificial arm or leg for almost any purpose, from recreational
activities to household chores, which is why it’s important to discuss your activities and goals
with them.Types of Prosthetics and
Prosthesis
Different types of prosthetic components available today are lighter, stronger, and easier to
control than previous versions. Fitting a prosthetic correctly is crucial as it affects mobility and
comfort. A prosthetist should always discuss the type of prosthetic you need and the best
attachment method.
Arm Amputation and Prosthetics
Upper extremity prostheses differ in function and control mechanisms. An amputee may either
have an active or passive arm, depending on their needs. Similarly, they also have the choice to
use their own body power to control the arm or external power sources.
Transradial
This type of prosthesis is an artificial arm that attaches below the elbow. A passive prosthesis
serves an artificial purpose, while active ones possess movement ability. A body-powered
prosthesis connects to the body by a series of cables that move when the body does. Advanced
prosthesis (myoelectric) uses electrodes to send a signal to the artificial limb, causing it to move
in the same way as a real hand.Transhumeral
Transhumeral prosthesis provides the functionality of the majority of the arm by replacing an
arm missing above the elbow. Like transradial prostheses, they are available in passive, body-
powered, external-powered, and hybrid options. Many patients opt for the hybrid type because it
provides motion and grip. The most common attachment system for transhumeral prostheses is a
suction or roll-on linear system.
Silicone Arms, Hands & Fingers
Silicone arms, hands, and fingers have a highly natural appearance because their color can be
matched to any skin tone. The soft material is molded to be thin at the edges for a natural
transition to the skin.
Most silicone prosthetics are suspended by means of a suction created between the prosthesis and
residual finger stump. As the prosthesis is pushed onto the residual stump, the air is expelled
between the silicon and the skin, which provides a secure and reliable suspension.When it comes to finger prosthetics, it is possible to have a metal implant (osseointegrated
implant) that extends from the end of the amputated finger and matches the length of the original
finger. This improves function and cosmetic appearance because it is internally supported by a
skeletal attachment.
Leg Amputation and Prosthetics
The type of prosthetic legs recommended to lower extremity patients depends on whether they
need above or below the knee devices. Each type requires a unique approach to regaining
optimum function after amputation.
Transtibial
This leg prosthetic type replaces the limb below the knee, which allows patients to retain the use
of their knee. The prosthetic socket is the main connection between the residual limb and the
prosthesis, which distributes the weight of the residual limb. Patients require rehabilitation to
achieve optimal mobility because the “feet” on transtibial prostheses don’t usually move.
Transfemoral
The need to include a knee joint mechanism for upper leg prosthesis makes transfemoral
prostheses more complex because they are critical to an amputee’s quality of life. These
prostheses play a determining role in a person’s ability to sit, stand, balance, and move around.
This type of prosthesis allows for seemingly normal movement after a lengthy rehabilitation
process.Types of Prosthetic Legs
Each amputee requires a different type of prosthetic limb designed to accommodate their
physical and lifestyle needs.
• Exoskeleton prosthesis: Also called conventional or crustacean type prosthesis, these
are traditionally constructed from wood or plastic. Their walls provide structural strength
and cosmetic shape; however, they are less customizable than endoskeleton prostheses.
• Endoskeleton: A prosthesis with a tubular structure that connects the primary
components, i.e., the socket, suspension system, foot, and knee unit.
• Knee options: Prosthetic knees can be mechanical or computerized. Mechanical knees
are subdivided into single-axis and multi-axis/polycentric knees. Single-axis knees bend
forward and backward, whereas polycentric ones can rotate on multiple axes. Regardless
of type, all knees come with stability locking systems, which are either manual or weight-
activated.Other Prosthesis Types
Like hand and arm prostheses, there are also different prosthetic foot types to accommodate
everyday and sporting needs. Silicon feet are cosmetic, whereas sports feet and mechanical feet
adapt in realistic ways to the range of motion of the human foot.
A dynamic prosthetic foot type such as microprocessor foot uses hydraulics to adjust to surfaces
and situations in real-time, allowing a nearly natural gait pattern. There are also different types of
ankle prostheses that come with foot components. Some have active ankle joints to produce a
natural, flexible feel during activities.
Also, part of prosthetics is hip prosthetics, used in hip replacement surgery. Most types of hip
prostheses are made with metals, ceramics, and others with plastic. Hip replacement surgery may
encompass a total or partial hip replacement, depending on the degree of damage. Other common
prosthetic implants include eyes and noses.
Conclusion
Modern advancements in prostheses have dramatically improved the range of motion and
comfort. Many of our patients wonder what the best type of prosthetic for a very active lifestyle
is; however, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.
At PrimeCare, we have a comprehensive range of custom prosthetics including below-knee
prosthetic types, as well as different types of prosthetic feet. Since 2009, we’ve helped residents
in Las Cruces and beyond with all their prosthetic and orthotic needs. Contact us to find out

Wheelchair Exercises for Weight Loss
Looking after your fitness levels is vital for both the health of your body and for
your mind. Exercising increases your stamina, helps you to lose weight and
releases endorphins which give you a positive mental boost. You might think
that getting the regular exercise that you need if you’re in a wheelchair is
impossible, but there are plenty of ways in which you can keep fit and active.
Most things you would think of for exercises can easily be adapted so that you
can perform them from your wheelchair.
In this month’s special post we’re going to take you through a whole host of
wheelchair exercises for weight loss. Ranging from the super simple stuff to the
slightly more intense and complicated movements, the exercises on
this list could certainly help you with your weight loss goals.
Bicep Curl
A simple movement, this exercise works your shoulders as well as your bicep,
keeping your arms strong and healthy. Ensure that you are sat up straight and
that your back is well supported in your chair. Now, using a small weight to
begin with you should curl your arm up so the weight comes to your shoulder
level. Lower your arm back down in a steady, smooth motion and repeat for your
opposite arm. Once you’ve mastered small weights you should try to progress
steadily with increased weights.
Overhead PressAgain, starting out with smaller weights and working upwards, the overhead
press can be done with weights in a seated position. Ensure you have back
support and begin with your arms by your side, holding the weights at shoulder
height. From here you should lift the weights above your head in a smooth
motion. This works your deltoids and improves your strength.
Abdominal Twist
If you need a weightless workout then the abdominal twist is great. Keep your
spine extended and simply twist your upper body from left to right and then
right to left so you’re facing to your side each time. Be careful not to strain too
far and, if you need support, lay your arms flat on your arm rests and grip them
to stabilise yourself. You shouldn’t jerk in a quick motion, it should be smooth
and slow, holding the twist for 5-10 seconds each.
Chest Presses
Using a medicine ball you can perform chest presses from your chair. Press the
medicine ball to your chest with your hands on each side, bending your elbows,
then push the ball outwards until your elbows almost lock. This is a great, easy
way to work your chest muscles, simply ensure your back is in a comfortable
position first.
Seated Woodchop
Another great exercise which ultilises the medicine ball is the seated woodchop.
This is designed to work your core abdominal muscles but is easy to do in your
wheelchair. Hold the ball beside your right hand side at your hip, turning your
upper body slightly. Then lift the ball across your body reaching above your
opposite shoulder. Alternate the left-to-right switch to ensure you work both
sides of your body.Using Kettlebells
There are plenty of exercises you can perform using kettlebells to build up your
strength, but be sure to start off with lighter weights before you try to tackle
heavy weights as this could could you more damage in the long run.
• Shoulder raises
• Shoulder presses
• Bicep curls
• Forearm raises
• Chest presses
• Oblique stretches
• Side strokes
• Tricep kickbacks
• Tricep extensions
Pull Ups
Whether you do this at a gym or get a pull up bar to install in your home, it’s a
great way to exercise your back muscles as well as other upper body muscles.
Simply align yourself under the pull up bar, reach out and place your grip
shoulder length apart then, using only your arms, raise your body up as far as you
can. It doesn’t matter if you can’t lift yourself all the way up at first, over time
you should build the strength to reach that point. Ensure you don’t strain your
back too hard and have someone spot for you during this exercise in case you
encounter difficulties.
Training Rollers
Training rollers allow you to stay in one place but exercise as if you were going
out and about. The back wheels of your chair sit on rollers, as you propel yourself
you will remain static but your wheels will roll. This simulates the action oftravelling outdoors and gives you vital exercise if the conditions aren’t suitable
outside due to inclement weather.
Weighted Punches/Speedbag
Several options are available to you if you want to train with punching or boxing.
You can either use weights, getting heavier progressively, to perform weighted
punches from a seated position, or you can use a speedbag if you’re already
beyond the novice stage. The speedbag can be adjusted in height giving you
different reaches and working different muscle groups in your arms shoulders
and back.
Wheelchair Sports
Generic as it may sound, the most fun way you can get exercise and aid your
weight loss attempts is by getting involved with a sport. There are plenty of
options to choose from when it comes to wheelchair sports and you might even
be able to find a team nearby to you. Swimming, given appropriate apparatus
and supervision is on hand, can be a great workout for your entire body and
reduces the strain put on your joints, while something such as basketball will
give a competitive edge to your exercise, working your arms and shoulders and
improving your strength.
Staying at a healthy body weight is important regardless of whether you are
in a wheelchair or not. These are just some of the ways you could get vital
exercise and strength training at home or in your local community. To get
further advice and receive specialist assistance, get in touch with you local
gym who should be able to assign you a fitness instructor to build a routine
with. After a while you should gain more confidence in your abilities,
allowing you to progress your routine and tackle your weight loss head on
with your own schedule."
When our fingers are working normally,"When our fingers are working normally, they provide us with enough strength
and dexterity to complete all kinds of everyday tasks—many of which we don’t
even think about. This includes everything from holding or grabbing small
objects to gardening, cooking, typing, gripping the car steering wheel, and even
climbing. Naturally, it can be frustrating when one or several fingers hurt,
become stiff and stop functioning, or are affected by an injured hand. Thankfully,
there are simple physical therapy finger exercises to get you back to doing what
you enjoy most.
While finger surgery may be the eventual recommendation, orthopedic surgeons
like ours here at Fort Worth Hand Center may recommend physical therapy
finger exercises to see if a conservative approach makes sense first.
Are You Experiencing Any of These Finger Symptoms?
• Pain in one or several fingers
• Stiffness and limited finger movement
• Dull and achy feeling
• Swelling
• Numbness or tingling
• Cramping, popping, or a “catching” sensation
• Locking fingers
• Decreased grip strength
• Dislocation, finger fractures, or break
• Arthritis
• Impingements
Hand and finger exercises can help strengthen your hands and fingers, increase
your range of motion, and may even give you pain relief.

What Is Physical Therapy?Musculoskeletal pain is the No. 1 reason people visit their doctors each year.
Because we use our fingers for everything, there are so many ways we can put
them at risk. In some cases, finger pain isn’t serious and will go away on its own.
But there are times when there has been a specific hand or finger injury that can
cause a bruise, fracture, and even muscle or tissue damage.
The point of physical therapy finger exercises is to restore hand and finger
function. It’s that simple. Physical therapy or physiotherapy has been around
since the early 1800s and can be customized to meet your unique needs.
Perhaps repeated typing or working with small objects has left you with arthritis
and degenerative weakness in your fingers. Or you jammed your finger in a
contact sport like football.
Physical therapy finger exercises increase mobility, improve strength, promote
proper alignment, and restore function. What your physical therapy entails really
depends on the type of issue you’re experiencing.
Your doctor will want to know your medical history, including any past injuries
to the affected area and symptoms. From the doctor’s prescription, a physical
therapist creates an exercise plan to fit your specific needs.
Common Physical Therapy Finger Exercises to Aide Your Recovery
1. Finger StretchTo improve range of motion, flexibility, and decrease pain in the fingers.
• Place your hand flat with palm down on a flat surface (ex: a table).
• Slowly straighten your fingers as flat as you can without forcing
anything.
• Hold this position for 30-60 seconds and repeat four times with
each hand.
2. Finger LiftAnother exercise to increase flexibility.
• Place your hand flat with palm down on a table.
• Slowly lift and lower one finger at a time off of the table.
• Repeat 8-10 times on each hand.
3. Thumb StretchThis is an easy stretch to get your fingers involved in overall hand mobility.
• Hold your hand out with your fingers and thumb straight.
• Bend your thumb across your palm and use each finger to touch your
thumb in succession.
• Repeat these rotations 20-30 times for each hand.
4. Claw StretchAnother easy physical therapy exercise for the fingers to improve range of
motion.
• Hold your hand out with your fingers and thumb straight.
• Bend your thumb across your palm and use each finger to touch your
thumb in succession.
• Repeat these rotations 20-30 times for each hand.
5. Foam Ball PinchThis exercise is like the soft ball squeeze exercise and helps strengthen the
muscles in your fingers and thumb.
• Hold and pinch a soft foam ball between the tips of your fingers and
thumb.
• Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat 10-15 times with both hands.
• Do this exercise 2-3 times per week.
6. DIP Joint BlockingGreat for strengthening your finger joints.
• Support your hand with the palm up, using your other hand to
support your finger just below the end joint.
• Bend and straighten the end joint (tip of the finger) while holding
for 3-5 seconds.
• Repeat on opposite hand.
7. Towel SqueezeA great physical therapy exercise for the fingers that improves grip strength.
• Place a towel roll on a table.
• With your palm facing down, gently grab the towel with your fingers
and squeeze.
• Hold for six seconds, then release and repeat 8-12 times."
Your Recovery Toe,"Your Recovery
You had amputation surgery to remove one or more of your toes. For most people, pain
improves within a week after surgery. You may have stitches or sutures. The doctor will
probably take these out about 10 days after the surgery. You may need to wear a cast
or a special type of shoe for about 2 to 4 weeks.
You may think you have feeling or pain where your toe had been. This is called
phantom pain. It is common, and it may come and go for a year or longer. If you have
this kind of pain, your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat it.
This care sheet gives you a general idea about how long it will take for you to recover.
But each person recovers at a different pace. Follow the steps below to get better as
quickly as possible.
How can you care for yourself at home?
Activity
• Rest when you feel tired. Getting enough sleep will help you recover.
• Follow your doctor's instructions about how much weight you can put on your foot and when
you can go back to your usual activities. If you were given crutches, use them as directed.
• Try to walk each day if you are able. Start by walking a little more than you did the day
before. Bit by bit, increase the amount you walk. Walking boosts blood flow and helps
prevent blood clots.
• You may notice some changes in your balance when you walk. Your balance will improve
over time.
• Ask your doctor if you should prop up your foot and leg on a pillow when you ice it or anytime
you sit or lie down. If your doctor wants you to do this, you can do it for the next 3 days. Try
to keep it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce swelling.
• Ask your doctor when you can drive again.
• You may shower, unless your doctor tells you not to. Keep the bandage dry. If the bandage
has been removed, you can wash the area with warm water and soap. Pat the area dry.
• You will probably need to take about 4 weeks off from work or your normal routine. How
much time you need to take off depends on the type of work you do and your overall health.
Diet
• You can eat your normal diet. If your stomach is upset, try bland, low-fat foods like plain rice,
broiled chicken, toast, and yogurt.• You may notice that your bowel movements are not regular right after your surgery. This is
common. Try to avoid constipation and straining with bowel movements. You may want to
take a fibre supplement every day. If you have not had a bowel movement after a couple of
days, ask your doctor about taking a mild laxative.
Medicines
• Your doctor will tell you if and when you can restart your medicines. You will also get
instructions about taking any new medicines.
• If you stopped taking aspirin or some other blood thinner, your doctor will tell you when to
start taking it again.
• Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
o If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it as prescribed.
o If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an
over-the-counter medicine.
• If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just
because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.
• If you think your pain medicine is making you sick to your stomach:
o Take your medicine after meals (unless your doctor has told you not to).
o Ask your doctor for a different pain medicine.
Incision care
• Your doctor will probably remove the bandages after several days. Or your doctor may have
you remove your bandages at home. Do not touch the surgery area. Keep it dry.
• Do not soak your foot until your doctor says it is okay.
Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and
go to all appointments, and call your doctor or nurse advice line (811 in most provinces
and territories) if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test
results and keep a list of the medicines you take.
When should you call for help?
Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:
• You passed out (lost consciousness).
• You have sudden chest pain, are short of breath, or you cough up blood.
Call your doctor or nurse advice line now or seek immediate medical care if:
• You have pain that does not get better after you take pain medicine.
• You are sick to your stomach or cannot drink fluids.• You have loose stitches, or your incision comes open.
• You have signs of a blood clot in your leg (called a deep vein thrombosis), such as:
o Pain in your calf, back of the knee, thigh, or groin.
o Redness or swelling in your leg.
• You have signs of infection, such as:
o Increased pain, swelling, warmth, or redness.
o Red streaks leading from the incision.
o Pus draining from the incision.
o A fever.
• You bleed through your bandage.
Watch closely for any changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor or
nurse advice line if you have any problems."
